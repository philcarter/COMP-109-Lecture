## [](#introducing-pivottable-design-under-the-data-model)Introducing PivotTable Design Under the Data Model

Standard PivotTables and PivotTables created from the Data Model do not support the same features. For example, you can create group field items in a standard PivotTable, but you can't with a PivotTable based on the Data Model. The two PivotTable types are complementary.

## [](#calculating-distinct-counts)Calculating Distinct Counts

A discount count is a count of the unique values from a field, which is different from the COUNT function which counts both unique values and duplicates. The DISCOUNT COUNT function is available in PivotTables created from the Data Model.

## [](#creating-a-measure)Creating a Measure

Because PivotTables based on the Power Pivot Data Model do not support calculated fields, you must define a measure, which is a calculation that summarizes data from a Data Model table. PivotTables use two types of measures: implicit and explicit.

> Tip: Measures become part of the table structure and are available to any new PivotTable that uses that table.

##### Introducing DAX

An explicit measure is written in the formula language Data Analysis Expressions, or more commonly known as DAX.

The RELATED Function  
`RELATED(Table[field])`

> Note: You must have defined a table relation to use the RELATED function.

The SUMX Function  
`SUMX(table, expression)`

## [](#retrieving-pivottable-data-with-getpivotdata)Retrieving PivotTable Data with GETPIVOTDATA

The GETPIVOTDATA function works with both standard PivotTables and PivotTables created under the Data Model. The syntax of the [GETPIVOTDATA function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/getpivotdata-function-8c083b99-a922-4ca0-af5e-3af55960761f?ocmsassetid=getpivotdata-function-8c083b99-a922-4ca0-af5e-3af55960761f&ns=excel&version=90&syslcid=1033&uilcid=1033&appver=zxl900&helpid=xlmain11.chm60406&ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) is: `GETPIVOTDATA(data_field, pivot_table, [field1, item1, field2, item2, ...])`

##### Proskills Problem Solving: _Retrieving Measures from OLAP Cubes_

><hr>Under the Data Model, you don’t need a PivotTable to display PivotTable results. This is because the Data Model stores data in a multidimensional array of fields and measures known as a Data Cube. A Data Cube is part of an Online Analytic Processing (OLAP) database that is designed for the efficient reporting a large datasets. Rather than calculating and re-calculating a data set that might have millions of records, an OLAP database has all those measures pre-stored for quick retrieval.
>
>The Data Model is based on a Data Cube model, which is why you can store large data sets in the Data Model and have PivotTables quickly retrieve and display measures without having to wait for Excel to recalculate the PivotTable values.
>
>You calculate measures directly from the Data Model without even needing a PivotTable by using the CUBEVALUE function
>
> ![Figure 11-77](../images/modules/M11/Figure%2011-77.png)
>
>where connection is the connection to an OLAP database like the Data Model and expression1, expression2, and so on are OLAP expressions that define how those measures should be filtered and retrieved. For example, the following formula retrieves the Sum of Revenue measure for the York Motel from the Data Model:
>
>![Figure 11-78](../images/modules/M11/Figure%2011-78.png)
>
>By adding more expressions to the CUBEVALUE function you can filter the Sum of Revenue measure to cover any motel or combination of motels within any date interval you choose. The CUBEVALUE function is one of 7 CUBE functions supported by Excel.

## [](#exploring-database-functions)Exploring Database Functions

Another way to summarize data from an Excel table or data range without using PivotTables is with a [Database function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/database-functions-reference-ad87e69b-fc20-4d3d-9d52-d7dc023f5c23) (or Dfunction). Database functions calculate summary statistics including AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, and SUM using criteria specified in a range. The general form of a Database function is: `Dfunction(database, field, criteria)`

*   **Database**     is the range of cells that makes up the list or database. A database is a list of related data in which rows of related information are records, and columns of data are fields. The first row of the list contains labels for each column.

*   **Field**     indicates which column is used in the function. Enter the column label enclosed between double quotation marks, such as "Age" or "Yield," or a number (without quotation marks) that represents the position of the column within the list: 1 for the first column, 2 for the second column, and so on.

*   **Criteria**     is the range of cells that contains the conditions you specify. You can use any range for the criteria argument, as long as it includes at least one column label and at least one cell below the column label in which you specify a condition for the column.
