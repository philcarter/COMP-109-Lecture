## [](#introducing-databases)Introducing Databases

A database is a structured collection of data. Databases are commonly used as the data sources for Excel workbooks.

Another possible source from which we might want to import data into an Excel worksheet is a database. An example of a typical database is an address book. One of the most important concepts for us is that to get information from a database, you must create a query. The query tells the database what information we want, which records we want it from, and how we want the data arranged.

A database is divided into separate tables. Each table is arranged in columns and rows; also referred to as fields and records. A field stores information about a specific characteristic of a person, place, or thing. A record is a collection of fields

Excel can retrieve data directly from most database programs

Different tables are connected through database relationships; fields common to each table are used to match records in different table. A one-to-one relationship is one in which one record in a table is matched to exactly one record from a second table. A one-to-many relationship is one in which one record is matched to one or more records in a second table. Relational databases are ones in which tables can be joined through the use of common fields

###### Tables related by a common field

##### Querying an Access Database

You then use the Query Editor to create a query that extracts data from any one table within those databases, or you can create a query that extracts data from several tables.

The data model is a database built into Excel that provides database tools. Data model database contents are immediately available to PivotTables, PivotCharts, and other Excel features. The data model is constructed from different tables related by common fields.

##### Proskills Written Communication: _Designing a Database_

><hr>Databases are great tools to organize information, track statistics, and generate reports. When used with Excel, a properly designed database can provide valuable information and help you make informed financial decisions. Whether you are creating a database in the Data Model or Microsoft Access, keep in mind the following guidelines:
>
> * Split data into multiple tables. Keep each table focused on a specific topical area. Link the tables through one or more common fields.
> * Avoid redundant data. Key pieces of information, such as a customer’s address or phone number, should be entered in only one place in your database.
> * Use understandable field names. Avoid using acronyms or abbreviations that may unclear or confusing.
> * Maintain consistency in data entry. Include validation rules to ensure that rules such as abbreviate titles (for example, Mr. instead of Mister) are always followed.
> * Test the database on a small subset of data before entering all the data. The more errors you weed out early, the easier it will be to manage your database.
>
>A badly designed or improperly used database will end up creating more problems rather than solving them.

The Power Pivot tab contains the commands from working with the data model. Use the Add to Data Model command to add Excel tables to the data model. Power Pivot displays the contents of the data model in a separate window from the Excel workbook window

##### Exploring the Data Model in Diagram View

You can also examine the Data Model in Diagram view, which lists the fields within each table. Diagram view is useful when you want to work with the general structure of the Data Model. From Diagram view, you can quickly define the relationships that connect the tables.

##### Managing Table Relationships

In one-to-many relationships, one of the tables acts as a lookup table for the other.

## [](#creating-a-pivottable-from-the-data-model)Creating a PivotTable from the Data Model

With Power Pivot and the Data Model, you can create PivotTables based on information contained in multiple tables drawn from a variety of data sources. Note that for a PivotTable to use multiple tables, the tables must be added to the Data Model and have table relationships defined based on common fields.

##### Applying Slicers and Timelines from the Data Model

Slicers and timeline can be applied across multiple tables if the tables are connected through a common field.
