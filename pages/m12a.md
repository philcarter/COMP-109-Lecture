## [](#planning-an-excel-application)Planning an Excel Application

An Excel application is a spreadsheet written or tailored to meet specific needs. Most applications include a customized interface to assist users, who are usually not Excel experts, to quickly and easily perform tasks without having to learn Excel.

Planning an application’s design and function is very important to do ahead of time. But too much planning is also not advisable. Traditional approach to software development is to gather all requirements at the start of a project, and after review and discussions implement them and then deliver the final product. You will also see many references in textbooks about gathering all of the requirements first. But that is not how most complex applications are implemented or used in the real world these days. They constantly change and evolve, because maybe not all the requirements are always known at the beginning and they do change over time.

Your application should be easy to maintain, upgrade and/or modify. Resist the urge of creating a magnum opus— —i.e., the one workbook like which there is no other! You will bury yourself and come to down to a glacial crawl. Beware of feature creep early on in the development. Create a smaller example, a minimum viable workbook instead. Eliminate waste!

> Tip: Find that balance and resist the dark side! Don’t do too much! Don’t do too little!

*   Practice continuous improvement.
*   Enjoy Freedom and be creative.
*   Be agile and stay lean.

WordArt is a Microsoft Office text box in which you create decorative text. It can make a dashboard come alive with interesting graphics and attractive images. You begin by picking a WordArt style from the gallery and then adding decorative effects using tools on the ribbon.

A funnel chart is a chart that compares values within a hierarchy. They get their name because they often appear in the shape of a funnel with the lowest level forming a wide top and the highest levels representing a progressively narrowing bottom.

## [](#hiding-error-values-with-the-iferror-function)Hiding Error Values with the IFERROR Function

One challenge of creating an Excel application is ensuring that users are not confused or distracted by error values that might appear in a cell. In place of an empty text string, you can enter a text message that describes the error in more detail.

##### Error values hidden with the IFERROR function

##### Proskills Written Communication: _Handling Error Values_

><hr>The IFERROR function is one of many functions supplied by Excel to catch errors. Another useful error function is the ISERROR function, which returns a value of TRUE if value is an error value and FALSE if it isn't:

>For example, the following expression tests whether cell B10 contains an error value:

>The advantage of the ISERROR function is that you can enter the formula in one cell, such as B10, and then place an informative message about any errors in cell B10 within an adjacent cell. The following formula nests an ISERROR function within an IF function to display one message if cell B10 is in error and a different message if it is not:

> The ISERROR function returns TRUE for any error value. To test for specific errors or specific data values, use the ISBLANK, ISNA, ISNUMBER, ISREF, ISLOGICAL, ISNONTEXT, or ISTEXT functions. For example, the ISNA function tests whether a cell is displaying the #N/A error value; the ISNUMBER function tests whether a cell contains a numeric value, and so forth. You can learn more about Excel error functions by viewing Excel Help.
>
> Remember that an Excel application is designed for users who are not Excel experts, so you want to take advantage of the Excel error functions to catch their errors for them. The end-user should focus on the task at hand, not on interpreting error values generated by the application.
