## [](#projecting-future-income-and-expenses)Projecting Future Income and Expenses

A key business report is the income statement, also known as a profit and loss statement, which shows a business’s income and expenses over a specified period of time.  
Income statements are often created:

* Monthly
* Semiannually
* Annually

###### Income Statement worksheet
![Figure 9-10 Income Statement worksheet](../images/modules/M09/Figure%209-10.png)

Most income statements are divided into three main sections:

* The Income section projects the income from sales as well as the cost of supplying those items.
* The Expenses section projects the general expenses incurred from operations.
* The Earnings section estimates the net profit and tax liability.

Another part of the income statement is the cost of sales, also known as the cost of goods sold. The difference between sales revenue and cost of goods sold is known as gross profit

##### Exploring Linear and Growth Trends

* Linear trend
* Values change by a constant **amount**
* Appears as a straight line
* Growth trend
* Values change by a constant **percentage**
* Appears as a curve; greatest increases occur near end of series

##### Linear and growth trends

##### Interpolating from a Starting Value to an Ending Value

If you know beginning and ending values in a series and whether they constitute a linear or growth trend, AutoFill can fill in missing values.

##### Extrapolating from a Series of Values

This differs from interpolation in that only a starting value is provided. Succeeding values are estimated by assuming that values follow a trend. Excel can extrapolate a data series based on either a linear trend or a growth trend

To extrapolate a data series:

*   Provide a step value representing the amount by which each value is changed
*   You do not have to specify a stopping value

## [](#calculating-depreciation-of-assets)Calculating Depreciation of Assets

Tangible assets are a company's non-cash assets such as equipment, land, buildings, and vehicles. Tangible assets wear down over time and lose their value; the loss of the asset’s original value doesn't usually happen all at once, but is spread out over several years in a process known as depreciation.

Why do we want to capture depreciation? Tax rules allow the original cost of the investment (tangible assets) to be subtracted from the company's reported income over the life of the tangible asset, reducing the company's tax liability. This process of allocating the original cost of the investment over the years of use is known as depreciation.

Different types of tangible assets have different rates of depreciation:

*   Some items depreciate faster than others
*   Some items maintain their value for longer

To calculate the depreciation of an asset, you need to know the following:

*   Asset's original cost
*   Length of the asset's useful life
*   Asset’s salvage value (value at the end of its useful life)
*   Rate at which the asset is depreciated over time

There are several ways to depreciate an asset

*   Straight-line depreciation
*   Declining balance depreciation

##### Straight-Line Depreciation

With straight-line depreciation, the asset loses value by equal amounts each year until it reaches the salvage value at the end of its useful life.

The [SLN function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sln-function-cdb666e5-c1c6-40a7-806a-e695edc2f1c8) has the syntax: `SLN(cost, salvage, life)`

*   Cost is the initial cost or value of the asset
*   Salvage is the salvage value of the asset at the end of its useful life
*   Life is the number of periods over which the asset will be depreciated

##### Declining Balance Depreciation

Under declining balance depreciation, the asset depreciates by a constant percentage each year.

*   Depreciation value is highest early in its lifetime.
*   As asset loses value, depreciation amounts steadily decrease, though the percentage decrease remains the same.
*   Is an example of a negative growth trend


###### Straight-line and declining-balance depreciation
![Figure 9-18 Straight-line and declining-balance depreciation](../images/modules/M09/Figure%209-18.png)

Asset depreciates more quickly initially under declining balance model than a straight-line mode. The [DB function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/db-function-354e7d28-5f93-4ff1-8a52-eb4ee549d9d7) has the syntax: `DB(cost, salvage, life, period[, month=12])`.

##### Adding Depreciation to an Income Statement

Depreciation is part of a company’s income statement because, even though the company is not losing actual revenue, it is losing worth as its tangible assets decline in value, and that reduces its tax liability

##### Proskills Decision Making: _Choosing a Depreciation Schedule_

><hr>How do you decide which method of depreciation is the most appropriate? The answer depends on the type of asset being depreciated. Tax laws allow different depreciation methods for different kinds of assets and different situations. In general, you want to choose the depreciation method that most accurately describes the true value of the asset and its impact on the company’s financial status.
>
> In tax statements, depreciation appears as an expense that is subtracted from the company’s earnings. So, if you accelerate the depreciation of an asset in the early years of its use, you might be underestimating the company’s profits, making it appear that the company is less profitable than it is. On the other hand, depreciating an asset slowly could make it appear that the company is more profitable than it really is. For this reason, the choice of a depreciation method is best made in consultation with an accountant who is fully aware of the financial issues and tax laws.
