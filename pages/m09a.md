## [](#introducing-financial-functions)Introducing Financial Functions

This module focuses on [financial functions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/financial-functions-reference-5658d81e-6035-4f24-89c1-fbf124c2b1d8), which are the Excel functions used for analyzing loans, investments, and financial metrics. Many financial functions deal with cash flow, which is direction of money to and from an individual or group.

Present value refers to the current value of a loan or investment, whereas future value references that loan or investment’s value at a future date.

> When using financial functions, here are some tips:
> 
> * Place all important financial variables at or near the top of a worksheet in plain view.
> * Use range names with the financial variables to make it easier to apply them in formulas and functions.
> * Be aware of cash flow issues.
> * Never place argument values directly into a financial formula
> * Make sure the arguments in a financial function are measured in the same unit of time

##### Calculating a Payment with the PMT Function

The PMT function is used to determine the size of payments made periodically to either repay a loan or reach an investment goal

The syntax of the [PMT function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pmt-function-0214da64-9a63-4996-bc20-214433fa6441?ocmsassetid=ha102752903&correlationid=e3b48932-e503-452a-b392-c388367abb64&ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) is: `PMT(rate, nper, pv [fv=0], [type=0])`

* Rate is the interest rate per period
* NPER is the total number of payment periods
* PV is the present value of the loan or investment
* FV is the future value of the loan or investment after all of the scheduled payments have been made
* Optional type argument specifies whether payments are made at end (type=0) or beginning (type=1) of each period
* Interest rate and payment period must use same time unit
* Cash flow indicates the direction of money to and from an individual or a company

Positive cash flow represents money that is coming to the individual or received  
Negative cash flow represents money that is leaving the individual or spent

*   The pv argument for a loan is positive because it represents the amount of money being borrowed (coming to the individual)
*   The PMT function for a loan returns a negative value because it represents money being spent to repay the loan (going away from the individual)
*   The pv argument is negative when used with investments because it represents the initial amount of money being invested (or spent)
*   The PMT function returns a positive value when used with investments because it represents returns from the investment coming back to the individual

###### Quarterly payment required to repay a loan

It is importance to know your financial situation before entering into a new or different situation. This section shows how to evaluate investment options using financial functions. Make sure you understand not only how to calculate using the functions, but also what each of the results mean. Many poor business decisions have been made because the wrong function was used to calculate.

##### [](#calculating-a-future-value-with-the-fv-function)Calculating a Future Value with the FV Function

* Use the default value of 0 for the future value when the intent is to repay a loan completely
* When a loan will not be completely repaid, you can use the FV function to calculate the loan’s future value

The syntax of the [FV function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/fv-function-2eef9f44-a084-4c61-bdd8-4fe4bb1b71b3) is: `FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv=0], [type=0])`[![Excel Formula Coach.png](https://canvas.sbcc.edu/courses/33499/files/14499420/download)](http://support.content.office.net/en-us/coach/excelcoach_FV_PartI.html)

##### Calculating the Payment Period with the NPER Function

Returns the number of payment periods, not necessarily the number of years

The syntax of the [NPER function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/nper-function-240535b5-6653-4d2d-bfcf-b6a38151d815) is: `NPER(rate, pmt, pv, [fv=0] [, type=0])`

##### Calculating the Present Value with the PV Function

The PV function calculates the present value of a loan or an investment

*   For a loan, the present value would be the size of the loan
*   For an investment, the present value is the amount of money initially placed in the investment account

The syntax of the [PV function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/pv-function-23879d31-0e02-4321-be01-da16e8168cbd) is: `PV(rate, nper, pmt, [fv=0], [type=0])` [![Excel Formula Coach.png](https://canvas.sbcc.edu/courses/33499/files/14499420/download)](http://support.content.office.net/en-us/coach/excelcoach_PV_PartI.html)

## [](#creating-an-amortization-schedule)Creating an Amortization Schedule

Amortization schedule specifies how much of each loan payment is devoted toward interest and toward repaying the principal. Principal is the amount of the loan that is still unpaid

###### Interest and principal payments
![Figure 9-5 Interest and principal payments](../images/modules/M09/Figure%209-5.png)

##### Calculating Interest and Principal Payments

*   To calculate the amount of a loan payment devoted to interest and to principal, use the IPMT and PPMT functions
*   The [IPMT function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/ipmt-function-5cce0ad6-8402-4a41-8d29-61a0b054cb6f) returns the amount of a particular payment that is used to pay the interest on the loan; it has the syntax: `= IPMT(rate, per, nper, pv, [fv=0], [type=0])`
*   The per argument defines the period for which you want to calculate the interest due
*   The [PPMT function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/ppmt-function-c370d9e3-7749-4ca4-beea-b06c6ac95e1b) calculates the amount used to repay the principal and has the following syntax: `= PPMT(rate, per, nper, pv, [fv], [type])`

##### Calculating Cumulative Interest and Principal Payments

*   Cumulative totals of interest and principal payments can be calculated using the CUMIPMT and CUMPRINC functions
*   The [CUMIPMT function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/cumipmt-function-61067bb0-9016-427d-b95b-1a752af0e606) calculates the sum of several interest payments and has the syntax: `=CUMIPMT(rate, nper, pv, start, end, type)`
    *   Start is the starting payment period for the interval you want to sum
    *   End is the ending payment period
*   This function has no fv argument; the assumption is that loans are always completely repaid
*   Note that the type argument is not optional; you must specify whether the payments are made at the start of the period (type=0) or at the end (type=1)

##### Proskills Written Communication: _Writing a Financial Workbook_

><hr>A properly written financial workbook should communicate key pieces of information in a way that is concise and quickly grasped. It should also be easily edited to allow exploration of what-if scenarios that analyze the impact of different assumptions on the financial bottom line. To help ensure that any financial workbook you create meets these goals, keep in mind the following principles:
>
> *   Place all important financial variables at or near the top of a worksheet so that they can be easily read by others. For example, place the interest rate you use in calculations in a clearly labeled worksheet cell.
> *   Use defined names with the financial variables to make it easier to apply them in formulas and functions.
> *   Clearly identify the direction of the cash flow in all your financial calculations by expressing the cash value as negative or positive. Using the wrong sign will turn the calculation of a loan payment into an investment deposit or vice versa.
> *   Place argument values in worksheet cells where they can be viewed and easily changed. Never place these values directly into a financial formula.
> *   When values are used in more than one calculation, enter them in a cell that you can reference in all formulas rather than repeating the same value throughout the workbook.
> *   Use the same unit of time for all the arguments in a financial function. For example, when using the PMT function to calculate monthly loan payments, the interest rate and the number of payments should be based on the interest rate per month and the total months to repay the loan.
>
> A financial workbook that is easy to read and understand is more useful to yourself and others when making business decisions.
