**Charts** — A graphic that represents data using bars, columns, dots, lines, or other symbols to make the data easier to understand and to make it easier to see the relationships among the data.

Charts show trends or relationships in data that are easier to see in a graphic representation rather than viewing the actual numbers or data.

Excel has more than 60 types of charts organized into the 10 categories described in Figure 4–1. Within each chart category are chart variations called chart subtypes You can also design custom chart types to meet your specific needs.

 Basically, a chart takes data and displays it as information via graphics. Its main purpose is to help us analyze financial information… as long as we select the correct chart type. So under Module 4 > Resources I have a web page linked – "Available Chart Types." Make sure you review it.

## [](#creating-a-pie-chart)Creating a Pie Chart

![food pie chart](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3411/3231227250_3988ee3398.jpg)

Pie charts are very useful for comparing values to each other in a data series. Pie charts have five elements that are common to most charts. We can select and format any chart element individually or we can apply a built-in style or chart layout to format all of these elements at once. In pie charts a common element is a data label, which is text associated with a data value and is added to the slices. The data labels are placed where they best fit in relation to the pie slices. A variation to a pie chart is an exploded pie charts which are useful when I want to emphasize one category. Although we can explode more than one slice, the resulting pie chart is rarely effective.

A pie chart is a chart in the shape of a circle divided into slices like a pie

*   Each slice represents a single value from a data series
*   Larger data values are represented with bigger pie slices
*   The relative sizes of the slices let you visually compare the data values and see how much each contributes to the whole

Pie charts are most effective with six or fewer slices, and when each slice is large enough to view easily.

The data displayed in a chart come from a data source, which includes one or more data series and a set of category values. The data series is the actual values that are plotted on the chart. The Charts category in the Quick Analysis tool displays chart types that are appropriate for the selected data source

##### Inserting a Pie Chart with the Quick Analysis Tool

After you select an adjacent range to use as a chart's data source, the Quick Analysis tool appears. It includes a category for creating charts. The Charts category lists recommended chart types—the charts that are most appropriate for the data source you selected.

###### Moved and resized pie chart
![Figure 4-6 Moved and resized pie chart](../images/modules/M04/Figure%204-6.png)

Pie slices do not need to be fixed within the pie. An exploded pie chart moves one slice away from the others as if someone were taking the piece away from the pie. Exploded pie charts are useful for emphasizing one category above the others.

So, what is an embedded chart? What are the advantages and disadvantages of the embedded chart? It means the chart is placed in a worksheet next to its data source. The advantage of an embedded chart is that you can display the chart alongside any text or figures that can explain the chart’s meaning and purpose. A disadvantage is that an embedded chart covers worksheet cells, which might contain data and formulas.

## [](#working-with-chart-elements)Working with Chart Elements

Every chart contains elements that can be formatted, added to the chart, or removed from the chart

The Chart Elements button is used to add, remove, and format individual elements. When you add or remove a chart element, the other elements resize to fit in the space. Live Preview shows how changing an element will affect the chart's appearance.

###### Common chart elements
![Figure 4-7 Common chart elements](../images/modules/M04/Figure%204-7.png)

##### Formatting a Chart Element

Each element listed in the Chart Elements button contains a submenu of common formatting choices, such as the placement of data labels relative to the position of the data marker or pie slice. One way of modifying the chart layout is to choose a predefined layout from the Quick Layout button on the Chart Tools Design tab.

##### Choosing a Chart Style

When you create a chart, the chart is formatted with a style (a collection of formats). In the pie chart created, the format of the chart title, the location of the legend, and the colors of the pie slices are all part of the default style. You can quickly change the appearance of a chart by selecting a different style from the Chart Styles gallery. Live Preview shows how a chart style will affect the chart.

##### Changing the Color Scheme

A pie slice is an example of a data marker that represents a single data value from a data series. You can format the appearance of individual data markers to make them stand out from the others. Pie slice colors should be as distinct as possible to avoid confusion.  
Depending on the printer quality or the monitor resolution, it might be difficult to distinguish between similarly colored slices or data.

## [](#performing-what-if-analyses-with-charts)Performing What-If Analyses with Charts

A chart is linked to its data source. Changes made to the data source affect the chart; a visual representation of changes. It makes charts a powerful tool for data exploration and what-if analysis. 

###### Filtered pie chart
![Figure 4-14 Filtered pie chart](../images/modules/M04/Figure%204-14.png)

Another type of what-if analysis is to limit the data to a subset of the original values in a process called filtering. Rather than creating a new chart, you can filter an existing chart to only show specific data.

## [](#creating-a-column-chart)Creating a Column Chart

*   Displays values in different categories as columns.
*   Height of each column is based on its value.

![50 Dollars Column Chart](https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8250/8496174577_82501ee284.jpg)

A column chart displays values in different categories as columns; the height of each column is based on its value. Related to the column chart is the bar chart, which is a column chart turned on its side, so each bar length is based on its value. Column and bar charts are superior to pie charts when the number of categories is large or the categories are close in value. It is easier to compare height or length than area.

## [](#creating-a-bar-chart)Creating a Bar Chart

*   Column chart is turned on its side.
*   Length of each bar is based on its value.

![Bar Chart-Horizontal](https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7152/6659043209_9f8bb75ca8.jpg)


Bar charts are typically used to compare several categories of data. Bar charts are ideal for visualizing the distribution or proportion of data items when there are more than three categories. For instance a bar chart could be used to compare the overall revenue distribution for a given set of products.

Better to use column and bar charts than pie charts when the number of categories is large or the data values are close in value. Easier to compare height or length than an area. Column charts can include several data series

##### Comparing Column Chart Subtypes

The clustered column chart displays the data series in separate columns side-by-side so that you can compare the relative heights of the columns The stacked column chart places the data series values within combined columns showing how much is contributed by each series.

The 100% stacked column chart makes the same comparison as the stacked column chart except that the stacked sections are expressed as percentages.

###### Column chart subtypes
![Figure 4-16 Column chart subtypes](../images/modules/M04/Figure%204-16.png)

###### Creating a Clustered Column Chart

*   Select data source
*   Select type of chart to create
*   Move and resize the chart
*   Change chart's design, layout, and format by selecting one of the chart styles, or formatting individual chart elements

##### Editing a Chart Title

At the top of the column chart, click Chart Title. Then type the new title and press ENTER.

##### Adding Gridlines to a Chart

A gridline is a line that extends from the chart’s horizontal and vertical axis into the plot area, making it easier to identify the values or categories associated with the chart’s data markers. You can use data labels to add data directly to a chart. Another way of viewing the data values associated with a chart is by adding a data table.

[Back to Top](#top)

## [](#creating-a-line-chart)Creating a Line Chart

![Line Chart](../images/modules/M04/line.jpg)

A line chart compares values from several categories with a sequential order, such as dates and times that occur at evenly spaced intervals. The values are indicated by the height of the line.

Line charts are typically used when the data consists of values drawn from categories that follow a sequential order at evenly spaced intervals. Like column charts, a line chart can be used with one or more data series. When multiple data series are included, the data values are plotted on different lines with varying line colors. You can modify the axis labels and tick marks to change which category values are displayed in the chart. 

Each value from a data series is represented by a data marker:

*   Individual pie slices in pie charts
*   Columns in column charts
*   Points connected by the line in a line chart

###### Formatted data markers in a line chart

## [](#creating-an-area-chart)Creating an Area chart

![Area Chart Dark](https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3356/3335225730_fd67f589b2.jpg)

Area charts are ideal for clearly illustrating the magnitude of change between two or more data points. For example, you can give your audience a visual feel for the degree of variance between the high and low price for each month.

##### Proskills _Written Communication: Communicating Effectively with Charts_

> <hr>Studies show that people more easily interpret information when it is presented as a graphic rather than in a table. As a result, charts can help communicate the real story underlying the facts and figures you present to colleagues and clients. A well-designed chart can illuminate the bigger picture that might be hidden by viewing only the numbers. However, poorly designed charts can mislead readers and make it more difficult to interpret data.
>
>  To create effective and useful charts, keep in mind the following tips as you design your charts:
>  *   **Keep it simple.** Do not clutter a chart with too many graphical elements. Focus attention on the data rather than on decorative elements that do not inform.
>  *   **Focus on the message.** Design the chart to highlight the points you want to convey to readers.
>  *   **Limit the number of data series.** Most charts should display no more than four or five data series. Pie charts should have no more than six slices.
>  * **Choose colors carefully.** Display different data series in contrasting colors to make it easier to distinguish one series from another. Modify the default colors as needed to make them distinct on the screen and in the printed copy.
>  * **Limit your chart to a few text styles.** Use a maximum of two or three different text styles in the same chart. Having too many text styles in one chart can distract attention from the data.

## [](#creating-a-combination-chart)Creating a Combination Chart

A combination chart combines two chart types within a single chart. It enables you to show two sets of data using the chart type that is best for each data set. You can have data series with vastly different values and you can create dual axis charts, using primary and secondary axes.

###### Combination chart preview
![Figure 4-24 Combination chart preview ](../images/modules/M04/Figure%204-24.png)

##### Working with Primary and Secondary Axes

When a chart has primary and secondary vertical axes, it is helpful to identify exactly what each axis is measuring. Add an axis title (a descriptive text that appears next to the axis) to the chart. You can add, remove, and format axis titles.

##### Adding an Axis Title

With the chart still selected, click the Chart Elements button then the Axis Titles check box.

*   Click Axis Title next to the primary axis and add your title, then press ENTER.
*   Click Axis Title along the bottom axis, type the title, then press ENTER.
*   Click Axis Title next to the secondary axis, and change the title, then press ENTER

##### Editing a Value Axis Scale

Excel automatically chooses the range of values, or scale, used on the value primary and secondary axes. It also automatically divides the scale into regular intervals, marked on the axis with tick marks and labels. Major tick marks identify the main units on the chart axis while minor tick marks identify the smaller intervals between the major tick marks.
