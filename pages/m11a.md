## [](#laying-out-a-pivottable)Laying Out a PivotTable

PivotTables, by default, include grand totals across all columns and rows.

You can lay out PivotTables in one of three ways:
* Compact
* Outline
* Tabular

##### PivotTable in a Tabular layout

##### Proskills Written Communication: _Setting Default PivotTable Options_
><hr>Some professions have design standards that all reports must follow. The default Compact layout might not one that you need use. Rather than changing the PivotTable layout every time you create a report, you can set your own preferred layout options.
>
>To define your PivotTable defaults, click Options in Backstage view to open the Options dialog box. In the Options dialog box, click the Data tab, and then click the Edit Default Layout button in the Data options section to make changes to the default layout of PivotTables. In the Edit Default Layout dialog box, specify whether to show subtotals and, if so, where they should be placed, whether to show grand totals for PivotTable rows and/or columns, and finally whether new PivotTables should be created using the Compact, Outline, or Tabular layouts. To save time, you can select a cell from an existing PivotTable and then click Import to use all the layout choices from that PivotTable as the defaults going forward. To set defaults for PivotTable options other than layouts, click the PivotTable Options button in the Edit Default Layout dialog box. In the PivotTable Options dialog box, you can set all the other PivotTable options for any new PivotTables you create.
>
> By defining your own PivotTable options, you can reduce the time required to create a finished report and make your reports more consistent in design and appearance. Note that the ability to set PivotTable defaults is a feature of Office 365 and Excel 2019 at the time of this writing. It might not be available in other Excel versions.

## [](#sorting-a-pivottable)Sorting a PivotTable

PivotTables labels are automatically sorted in alphabetical order if they contain text or chronological order if they contain date/time values.

> Tip: Excel makes it easy to sort lists in ascending or descending order based on any field(s) in the list. The field(s) selected on which to sort are called the sort fields or the sort keys. You may choose to sort the data on a single field or on a collection of fields.

##### Manually Sorting a Field

To change the order of the field items you can use your mouse to drag and drop the item labels in your preferred order. A quicker approach is to select each item label and retype its name.

##### Sorting by Value

You can have Excel automatically sort a field by clicking the Filter button next to the field name and selecting a sorting option from the menu.

## [](#filtering-a-pivottable)Filtering a PivotTable

The four types of filters that can be applied directly to PivotTable fields are:

* Manual filters, which select values from check boxes listing all of the unique field values
* Date filters, which select data based on specific dates or date ranges
* Label filters, which select data based on the labels of the items in the field
* Value filters, which filter data based on values of a numeric field elsewhere in the PivotTable

## [](#grouping-pivottable-fields)Grouping PivotTable Fields

> Tip: Often there is so much data in a worksheet that it is difficult to analyze the data. A PivotTable report provides a meaningful summary of the data in an organized manner. In the PivotTable, data is summarized into categories of data. The planning of the PivotTable is essential to achieve the desired results.

##### Manual Grouping

One way of creating a PivotTable group is through a manual group in which items within a field are combined to create a new group that appears as a new field within the PivotTable.

##### Grouping by Dates

When Excel encounters a date field that spans more than one year, it automatically groups the date values into quarters, months, and years. The grouping ends at the month level, so under the current grouping there is no way to view individual dates unless you regroup the data.

##### Grouping By Numeric  Fields
