##### Creating a hierarchy of fields.

View the Data Model in Diagram view in the Power Pivot window. Click the Create Hierarchy button in the table box to create a hierarchy for the table. Then Specify a name for the hierarchy and drag fields into the hierarchy, arranged in order from the most general down to the most specific.

##### Outlining a PivotTable by Nested Fields

When you nest fields within in a PivotTable row or column, Excel adds outline buttons to expand your view of the data at a greater level of detail or collapse to get a more general view.

##### Drilling Down a Field Hierarchy

Unlike outlines involving multiple fields nested within one another, a hierarchy displays only one field level at a time. To go from the most specific field to the most general, you drill up the hierarchy

##### Viewing Data with the Quick Explore Tool

The Quick Explore Tool is a feature of PivotTables and PivotCharts used to drill into data at any level of specificity or to explore the impact of other fields on your analysis. As with PivotTables, drilling down or up a PivotChart replaces the categories from one field with those of another.

Excel supports two types of map charts. In a value map, regions are filled with a color gradient based on the numeric value associated with each region. In a category map, regions belonging to the same category share the same color.

###### Value and category maps

##### Creating a Value Map Chart

Be careful about the effect of filters. Some states might not be represented under some filters and thus would not be listed in the PivotTable.

##### Proskills Problem Solving: _Specifying a Map Location_

><hr>The map chart uses location names from the search site Bing to determine where to place data values. However, this can result in misplacing map locations when several regions share the same name. Does “Georgia” mean the state of Georgia within the United State or the country of Georgia located north of Turkey? Does “Norfolk” refer to the county in Massachusetts or the province in England? There are 31 different counties named “Washington” alone. Bing will use the context of other regions in your data list to decide on a location, but it can make mistakes.
>
>To avoid confusion, include several columns in your data source: one to specify the country, another to specify the state, and a third to specify the county (if needed). You can also include a detailed region name such as “Georgia, United States” rather than simply “Georgia” to indicate that the location is a state within the United States and not an Eastern European country. Finally, avoid abbreviations when possible. Spell out state names like Indiana rather than the two-letter abbreviation IN. Many regions share the same abbreviation. If your data is not mapped correctly, try different combinations of names and locations to correct the problem.

##### Formatting a Map Chart

Excel supports several formatting options specific to map charts.

##### Visualizing Data with 3D Maps

Map presentations are called tours, and each tour contains one or more map scenes that can be played as a movie with one map scene transitioning into another. The 3D map window is organized into four sections.

##### Choosing a Map Style

* Stacked Column map
* Clustered Column map
* Bubble map
* Heat map
* Region map

##### Creating New Scenes

New scenes can be created using an empty world map as the background. You can also create customized scenes with backgrounds of your choosing.

###### Tour with two scenes
![Figure 10-47 Tour with two scenes](../images/modules/M10/Figure%2010-47.png)

##### Setting Scene Options

Each scene in a tour has a duration measured in the seconds. The default duration is 10 seconds, but you can change the duration by modifying the scene options. You can also change the length of time required to transition from one scene to the next.

##### Playing a Tour

Playing a tour presents all the scenes of the tour in order using the scene options you set.
