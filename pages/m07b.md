## [](#creating-pivottables)Creating PivotTables

Every PivotTable includes the following four primary areas:

*   Rows area—displays category values from one or more fields arranged in separate rows
*   Columns area—displays categories from one or more fields arranged in separate columns
*   Values area—displays summary statistics for one or more fields at each intersection of each row and column category
*   Filters area—contains a filter button that limits the PivotTable to only those values matching specified criteria

##### Inserting a PivotTable

To create a PivotTable, click in a data range or an Excel table, and then click the PivotTable button in the Tables group on the Insert tab. Excel reserves a space 3 columns wide by 18 rows tall for the initial PivotTable report. If the worksheet does not have enough empty space, you’ll be prompted to overwrite the cell content

##### Creating a PivotTable Layout

The PivotTable layout is created by dragging fields from the field list into one of the four area boxes. This determines the basic structure of the PivotTable. There is no particular order that the areas of the table need to be filled in.

##### Modifying the PivotTable Layout

PivotTables are excellent for data exploration because you can quickly change the PivotTable layout to view your data from many different angles. To change the content of the PivotTable, drag fields out of any of the four area boxes to remove them from the table and drop new fields into the area boxes to add them.

##### Adding Multiple Fields to a Row or Column

PivotTables are not limited to a single field in the Rows or Columns area. You can place additional fields in each area, nesting one field within another.

##### Filtering a PivotTable

The Filters area is a quick way to filter PivotTable data. When you add a field to the Filters area, a filter button appears two rows above the upper-left corner of the table. You can then use the button to choose a value to filter the entire PivotTable by.

## [](#formatting-a-pivottable)Formatting a PivotTable

You can format PivotTables to make them more visually appealing and the results easier to read. You should format a PivotTable after you have decided on its structure, layout, and content.

> Tip: You can use a field name as the label by adding a blank space to the end of the label name.

##### Choosing a PivotTable Summary Function

By default, Excel uses the COUNT function to summarize non-numeric data and the SUM function for numeric data. However, sometimes you’ll want to use different statistics in your analysis.

##### Reordering PivotTable Categories

Once you define the category order, that order becomes part of the PivotTable cache , which stores information about the PivotTable. If you move the Engagement Level field to another area of the table or remove it and add it back in later, Excel will remember your preferred category order, so you will not have to redefine it.

###### PivotTable Options dialog box

Several default values and behaviors are associated with PivotTables. For example, Excel automatically sorts the row and column categories and displays missing combinations within the PivotTable as blank cells. You can modify these defaults in the PivotTable Options dialog box.

##### Proskills Written Communication: _Making PivotTables Accessible_

> <hr> Many companies and government agencies require documents to be accessible to users with visual impairments and special needs. Excel provides support for those users by making objects such as charts, graphics, and PivotTables accessible through alternate text.
>
>To add alternate text to a PivotTable, open the PivotTable Options dialog box, and go to the Alt Text tab. On the Alt Text tab, you can specify a title for the alternate text. The title provides a brief description of the alternate text so that the user can decide whether to continue to review the PivotTable content. Below the title box, you can insert a description of the PivotTable. The description can be a general overview of the table’s contents or a detailed summary of the PivotTable numbers and summary statistics. There is no character limit on alternate text, though a general guideline is to limit the summary to about 160 characters.
>
>If you have to add alternate text to many objects in your workbooks, you can add the Alt Text command to the Quick Access Toolbar. For information on modifying the Quick Access Toolbar, refer to Excel Help.

###### PivotTable with style and options
![Figure 7-38 PivotTable with style and options](../images/modules/M07/Figure%207-38.png)

Just as you can apply built-in styles to Excel tables, there are built-in styles that you can apply PivotTables. These styles are available in the PivotTable Styles gallery, which includes a variety of column and row colors. Another design feature you might want to remove are the filter buttons from the PivotTable’s row and column areas.

> Tip: You can hide the PivotTable field pane by deselecting the Field List button in the Show group on the PivotTable Tools Analyze tab.
