## [](#introducing-pivotcharts)Introducing PivotCharts

*   The Axis (Category) area displays categories that each data series is plotted against.
*   The Legend (Series) area breaks up the data values into separate data series.
*   The Values area contains the data values that are plotted on the PivotChart.
*   The Filters area contains a filter button that limits the PivotChart to only those values satisfying specified criteria.

##### Creating a PivotChart

A PivotChart is created either from an existing PivotTable or created at the same time as its PivotTable. The layout of a PivotTable and PivotChart always mirror one another. Any changes you make to the structure and layout of a PivotTable affect the PivotChart, and vice versa. Not every Excel chart type can be created as a PivotChart.

##### Moving a PivotChart to Another Worksheet

The PivotTable and PivotChart do not need to be on the same worksheet (though they must be in the same workbook).

## [](#using-slicers-and-pivottables)Using Slicers and PivotTables

Another way of filtering PivotTable and PivotCharts is with a slicer. By clicking a slicer button, you can limit the PivotTable and PivotChart to a select group of records.

##### Applying a Slicer to Multiple PivotTables

The same slicer can be applied to multiple PivotTables. They do not need to be in the same worksheet but only the same workbook. A slicer is not applied directly to a PivotChart, only the PivotTable that PivotChart is based on.

##### Creating a Timeline Slicer

A timeline slicer filters a PivotTable to include only those records from a specified date interval

##### Proskills Problem Solving: _Consolidating Data from Multiple Worksheets_

><hr>This module worked with PivotTables whose data is stored within a single data range or Excel table. However, some projects require PivotTables that analyze data spread across several worksheets.
>
>One way of summarizing, or consolidating, data from multiple worksheets is with the Consolidate Data command. Click the Consolidate button in the Data Tools group on the Data tab to open the Consolidate dialog box. From the Consolidate dialog box, first choose the function for consolidating the data, such as average, count, minimum, and maximum, among others. Then, select a list of ranges from different worksheets containing the data to be consolidated, including any row or column labels to identify the data. Excel will generate a table containing the statistical summary for the data from multiple worksheets.
>
>Unlike PivotTables, the Consolidate command does not create an interactive table, so you must recreate the table each time you want to analyze your data from a different point of view. The consolidation table also does not interact with slicers or timelines, so you cannot filter the results. You can learn more about the Consolidate command in Excel Help.

###### Drilling into PivotTable data 
![Figure 7-52 Drilling into PivotTable data ](../images/modules/M07/Figure%207-52.png)

A PivotTable summarizes data, but sometimes you will want to examine the data records themselves. You can do this by drilling down the PivotTable to display the records responsible for the PivotTable calculations. To drill down a PivotTable, double-click any cell within the table. Excel then opens a new sheet displaying the records used to calculate that PivotTable value.
