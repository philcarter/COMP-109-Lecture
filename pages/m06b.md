##### Finding and Selecting Multiple Cells
Find & Select can locate cells that match a specified criterion. For example, you can use Find & Select to locate employees by their last name, base salary, or date of hire.

##### Finding Cells by Type
Find & Select can also locate cells based on criteria other than cell value, such as whether the cell contains a formula, constant, blank, or conditional formatting rule.

##### Filtering Based on One Field
Filtering data hides the rows whose values do not match the search criteria. Those rows are not removed from the worksheet. They can be redisplayed by removing the filter or applying a new filter

###### Filter criteria
![Figure 6-17 Filter criteria](../images/modules/M06/Figure%206-17.png)

##### Filtering Based on Multiple Columns
*   You can filter a data range based on criteria from multiple fields. Each additional filter reduces the number of records displayed since a record has to fulfill all filter criteria to be selected.
*   To use filters from multiple fields, select the filter button from other column headers in the data range.

##### Using Criteria Filters
*   The filters created are limited to selecting records for fields matching a specific value or set of values.
*   For more general criteria, you can create criteria filters, which are expression involving dates and times, numeric values, and text strings.

##### Clearing Filters
Once you have the information you need from the filtered data range, you can clear all the filters, revealing any hidden rows and columns. You’ll clear the date filters from the employees list.

##### Applying an Advanced Filter
*   Advanced filtering provides a way of writing more complicated filter criteria that involve expression that combine fields using the AND and OR logical operators.
*   To write an advanced filter, you must define a criteria range that lays out the specifications of the filter

## [](#creating-an-excel-table)Creating an Excel Table
Excel tables provide many advantages to structured ranges of data. When you create an Excel table, you can perform the same operations as you can for a structured range of data. Each time I supply an excel report to one of my clients, I provide the data range always as a table. 

##### Converting a Range to a Table
Excel tables support several features that are not available with data ranges, including:

*   Sorting and filtering tools built into the table itself
*   Table styles to format different features of the table, including banded rows and columns
*   Automatic insertion of a totals row containing summary statistics for each field, which update as records are inserted or deleted
*   Calculated values that use field names rather than cell references to make formulas easier to write and understand
*   Named references to different parts of the table structure, including table columns, total rows, and header rows

An Excel table has the following structural elements:
*   Header row—The first row of the table containing the field names
*   Total row—A row at the bottom of the table containing summary statistics for selected fields
*   First column—The leftmost column of the table
*   Last column—The rightmost column of the table
*   Banded rows—The odd- and even-numbered rows of the table formatted differently to make records easier to distinguish
*   Banded columns—The odd- and even-numbered columns of the table formatted differently to make fields easier to distinguish
*   Filter buttons—Buttons next to each field name for filtering and sorting the table data

##### Using Table Styles
Because an Excel table is composed of structural elements, you can apply styles to different parts of the table Table styles do not, by default, override the formatting applied to individual cells

##### Adding a Total Row
A useful table element for data analysis is the Total row, which is added to the end of the table after the last data record. The Total row calculates summary statistics, including the average, sum, minimum, and maximum of select fields within the table.

##### Adding and Deleting Records
*   When you add or delete records within an Excel table, the table adjusts to the new contents.
*   The format applied to the banded rows updates to accommodate the new data set size. The calculations in the Total row reflect the new data.

##### Creating a Calculated Field
So far, all of the fields in the table contain entered values. A field can also contain a formula that references other fields in the table. Such a field is called a calculated field, and it updates automatically as other field values in the table change. Instead of cell references, formulas in a calculated field use field names enclosed in brackets as follows: [field]

##### Structural References and Excel Tables
References to fields and elements in an Excel table are called structural references and are enclosed within square brackets [ ]. An important symbol in a structural reference is the @ symbol, which refers to the current record or row within the table
