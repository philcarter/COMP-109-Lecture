Visual presentation of a worksheet helps keeps the displayed elements clean and easy to read for your user. A good Excel Workbook should be consistent, efficient and clear. This is accomplished by proper formatting, and Excel’s formatting options are quite extensive. Those options allow for the fine-tuning of cell appearance, values, and plenty of options for colors, borders, and features alike.

If you are working for a company, they will most likely have formatting standards already established all the way down to what fonts, size, and colors to use. If not, there are some universal standards for certain formatting, especially when working with financial data. Proper formatting standards are most important for actual financial/accounting data. And even when we are working with non-calculations, such as for examples address lists, phone-numbers, shopping lists or invoices, still be consistent in our formatting.

For learning purposes, this course will instruct us to use certain color schemes or formatting that do not adhere to a universal standard. In that case, please follow the textbook/project instructions.

## [](#formatting-numbers)Formatting Numbers

The first and easiest method of formatting is to use a consistent color scheme to annotate different types of cells and data. Here is a recommended color scheme for fonts used in the world of finance:

*   **<span style="color: #0000ff;">Blue</span>**: All hard-coded (i.e. manually entered/input) numbers; For example when I enter sales for the last three quarters. This also includes assumptions and input cells.
*   **Black**: Formulas and functions. This includes adding two numbers that are both from other worksheets.
*   **<span style="color: #008000;">Green</span>:** All direct links to cells in other worksheets or workbooks
*   <span style="color: #ff0000;">**Red:**</span> references to separate files or external links

By selecting the Number group on the Home tab I can select a number format, apply accounting or other currency formats, change a number to a percentage, insert a comma as a thousands separator, and increase or decrease the number of digits displayed to the right of the decimal point.

Reducing the number of decimal points displayed in a cell does not change the cell's value, but merely rounds off the lowest digit. Do not round the numbers when we input numbers; I recommend that we enter all decimals and then use Excel to round the display of the data. Keeping the input data raw whole will help maintain data integrity and reduces rounding errors.

Accounting and Currency number formats ![figure2-10.png](../images/modules/M02/figure2-10.png)

One possible source of confusion is the difference between the Currency format and the Accounting format. Use the Currency format for general monetary values. I use the Accounting format when I want to align decimal points within a column. I also appreciate how Accounting handles zeros.

Questions to consider:

*   What might the General number format be good for?
*   What are some other ways to format numbers?

## [](#formatting-cell-text)Formatting Cell Text

Format all text in the **Black** font color.

###### Serif and Sans Serif.

SERIF fonts are have tapers or decorative lines added to fonts. They are considered more traditional. Now, SANS SERIF, are a little more modern. But neither is a bad choice, but stick to one style when working with worksheets, and if you do not have a preference, use SANS SERIF.

"Arial" is probably the most common type font, although I use "Calibri" a lot because it looks better on computers. Another good choice is "Helvetica".

Font size doesn't matter quite that much as long as we are consistent; we might see anything from 10 point font to 12 point font. A common mistake I see though is Column and Row headers being in a much larger font then the actual data. In my opinion this distracts from the actual information. Headers just give the data a reference, and really should not be larger then the actual information.

## [](#working-with-fill-colors-and-backgrounds)Working with Fill Colors and Backgrounds

Now let me caution you about styling and color: I am presenting my analysis of data, not create an artwork of colors. Color can enhance or detract from the content. So be consistent in our formatting, and work with complimentary colors. Use colors based on the audience and the information contained in the worksheet.

Normally, I only include borders around the financial statements and supporting schedules, such as those for revenue and expense sheets. We should NOT overuse borders or our worksheet will be much more difficult to read and interpret. I can also include bottom borders beneath or above date rows, but I should not make a "box" there. 

![fig2-3](https://canvas.sbcc.edu/courses/33499/files/14346579/download?wrap=1)

I very rarely want to use any type of fill color to change the background color of cells – keep most areas white, and only do this for the main titles, key summary rows and perhaps on any graphs or charts you create.

In summary,

*   Use colors from the same theme.
*   Use colors to differentiate types of cell content and direct users where to enter data.
*   Avoid garish color combinations.
*   Print the workbook both in color and black-and-white.
*   Understand your printer's limitations.
*   Be sensitive to your audience.

## Exploring the Format Cells Dialog Box

Check out the buttons on the Home tab, which provide quick access to the most common formatting, but you can also use the Format Cells dialog box.

I can add a gradient fill to any worksheet cell by opening the Format Cells dialog box and clicking the Fill tab; select the fill options from the commands on the tab.

There are six formatting tabs with a quick explanation how they are used.

*   Number: Provides options for formatting the appearance of numbers, including dates and numbers treated as text (for example, telephone or Social Security numbers)
*   Alignment: Provides options for how data is aligned within a cell
*   Font: Provides options for selecting font types, sizes, styles, and other formatting attributes such as underlining and font colors
*   Border: Provides options for adding cell borders
*   Fill: Provides options for creating and applying background colors and patterns to cells
*   Protection: Provides options for locking or hiding cells to prevent other users from modifying their contents)

## [](#formatting-worksheet-cells)Formatting Worksheet Cells

When I enter numbers and formulas into a cell, Excel automatically aligns them with the cell's right edge and bottom border, while text entries are aligned with the left edge and bottom border. I can control the alignment of data within a cell both horizontally and vertically. I can also have Excel shrink the text to fit within the given column width I have chosen or even rotate text .

The grid lines we see in Excel in a new worksheet are not displayed on printed pages. It is helpful in some cases to display borders around cells.

I can display the date value underlying any Excel date (or time) by changing the format of the cell from a date or time format to the General number format.

## [](#applying-cell-styles)Applying Cell Styles

Whenever several cells need to use the same format, I can create a style for those cells. A style is a saved collection of formatting options—number formats, text alignment, font sizes and colors, borders, and background fills—that can be applied to cells in the worksheet. Excel remembers which styles are associated with which cells in the workbook. If I modify the specifications for a style, the appearance of any cell associated with that style would be automatically changed to reflect the new style.

The most efficient way to apply a built-in style is:

1.  First select the cell or range.
2.  Next, in the Styles group on the Home tab, click the Cell Styles button.
3.  Click the style to apply to the selected cell or range.

## [](#copying-and-pasting-formats)Copying and Pasting Formats

I can create my own cell styles by clicking the Cell Style button from the Styles group on the Home tab and clicking New Cell Style. Excel will open a dialog box from which we can specify the format of the cell style. Cell styles can be saved with the current workbook and then merged with other workbooks.

The Format Painter copies and pastes only formatting. When I copy and paste, I can also use the Paste Options button, which lets me choose whether to paste the formatting from a copied range along with its contents. With the Paste Special dialog box, we can specify exactly what we want to paste.

## [](#highlighting-cells-with-conditional-formats)Highlighting Cells with Conditional Formats

Conditional formatting in a worksheet is a special formatting applied only to certain cells depending on one or more conditions. If the cell contents meet the condition or conditions I specify, the formatting is applied to the value. It is a very helpful tool. I use it all the times to check for duplicate values. But it requires a lot of managing, especially when I do a lot of copy and paste after I already applied conditional formatting. I always check 'Manage Rules' under 'Conditional Format' to delete duplicates or change the rule order. Also, if I have too many conditional formats, my worksheet will slow down a lot. To remove all conditional formatting from a worksheet, click Clear Rules from Entire Sheet. To remove it from the selected range, click Clear Rules from Selected Cells.)

## [](#summary)Summary

We've covered a lot of points, but the bottom-line on formatting is that consistency is more important than minutiae. Yes, get the color coding right and make sure our worksheet is legible to other users.

And yes again, formatting is an important aspect of our workbooks, but do not worry about it during development. The best way to go is saving the style of a worksheet for last. And don't spend hours and hours on tiny details unless our boss or someone above our boss is requesting it( Personal Note: I once had a Vice President spend an entire meeting on the different color choice he requested for each different day of the week, instead of the actual data.)

And when we are dealing with time pressure, just remember content is greater then display. Numbers, structure, and correct formulas matter more than aesthetic formatting issues.
