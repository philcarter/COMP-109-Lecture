## [](#validating-data-entry)Validating Data Entry

Excel provides features that will help validate data as it is entered into a worksheet. We can specify the type of data that is allowed and/or a range of acceptable values. If a value is entered that does not meet the requirements, an error message is displayed. Setting a rule like this is a preventative measure, which allows us to validate data upon entry. There are several different options in the Data Validation dialog box allowing students to provide various rules related to data entry. I can also provide an input message that will aid the user in entering the data.

Every validation rule is based on validation criteria specifying values allowed within a worksheet cell or range. Validation rules are tested only when the user exits Edit mode.

##### Creating an Error Alert Style and Message

An error alert determines what happens after a user tries to make an invalid entry in a cell that has a validation rule defined.

The three error alert styles are:

*   Stop: Prevents the entry from being stored in the cell
*   Warning: Prevents the entry from being stored in the cell unless the user overrides the rejection and decides to continue using the data
*   Information: Accepts the data value entered, but allows the user to choose to cancel the data entry

##### Creating an Input Message

One way to reduce the chance of a data-entry error is to display an input message when a user makes the cell active. An input message provides additional information about the type of data allowed for that cell. Input messages appear as ScreenTips next to the cell when the cell is selected. You can add an input message to a cell even if you don’t set up a rule to validate the data in that cell.

##### Validating Against a List

Another type of validation rule limits data values to a predefined list of accepted choices. Such lists appear within the cells as a drop-down list box from which the user can select a value, removing the need for typing. The list can be based on cells within the worksheet or entered directly into the Data Validation dialog box as a comma separated list.

##### Creating a Custom Validation Rule

A custom validation rule is based on a logical expression that evaluates something as either TRUE (valid) or FALSE (invalid). For example, the expression A10 = B10 returns a value of TRUE if cell A10 is equal to cell B10 and FALSE if it is not.

##### Validating Data Already in the Workbook

To validate data already entered in the workbook, do the following:

1.  Enter a validation rule for the range of cells you want to validate.
2.  On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click the Data Validation arrow, and then click Circle Invalid Data. Red circles surround each cell containing invalid data.
3.  To remove the validation circles, edit the cell(s) to make them valid or click the Data Validation arrow and click Clear Validation Circles.

## [](#hiding-workbook-content)Hiding Workbook Content

Excel workbooks often contain content you don’t want users to see. You can hide worksheet rows and columns or entire worksheets from the user.

##### Unhiding Multiple Sheets

1.  Press ALT+F11 to open the Visual Basic for Applications editor.
2.  Press CTRL+G to open a window in which you can enter programming commands.
3.  Type For Each ws In Sheets:ws.Visible=True:Next in the window, and then press ENTER.

## [](#protecting-workbook-content)Protecting Workbook Content

Another way to minimize data-entry errors is to limit access to certain parts of the workbook. Worksheet protection prevents users from changing cell contents, such as editing formulas in a worksheet. It also prevents users from changing the workbook’s organization, such as inserting or deleting worksheets in the workbook. You can also keep users from viewing the formulas used in the workbook.

Once I have a worksheet that I know is correct, I may want to protect the worksheet so that users cannot make changes. Excel allows me to protect a portion of the worksheet or all of the worksheet. Setting the locked property will disallow any changes to a particular cell. The worksheet will have to be protected in order for the locked property to have any effect. I can also specify a password that must be entered in order to remove worksheet protection. Finally, I can protect an entire workbook, which would disallow changes to the workbook such as adding or deleting worksheets in the workbook.

As a workbook designer, you will often establish formulas for the worksheet that must not be changed. However, the designer wants the user to be able to enter data into other cells in the workbook. The cells that should not be changed would be locked and the cells that the user should be able to change should be unlocked. Remember: locked cells are only effective if protection is turned on.

##### Protecting a Worksheet

When you set up worksheet protection, you specify which actions are still available to users in the protected worksheet. You can limit the user to selecting only unlocked cells, or allow the user to select any cell in the worksheet; these choices remain active as long as the worksheet is protected. A protected worksheet can always be unprotected. You can add a password that must be entered to turn off the protection

##### Protecting a Workbook

Worksheet protection applies only to the contents of a worksheet, not to the worksheet itself. To keep a worksheet from being modified, you need to protect the workbook. You can protect both the structure and the windows of a workbook. Protecting the structure prevents users from renaming, deleting, hiding, or inserting worksheets.

##### Unprotecting a Worksheet and a Workbook

You can always unprotect a protected worksheet to make additional edits to its content. If you assigned a password when you protected the worksheet, you must enter that password to remove worksheet protection. Likewise, you can unprotect a protected workbook to make changes to its structure, such as if you need to insert a new worksheet or rename an existing worksheet.

##### Locking and Unlocking Cells

Every cell in a workbook has a locked property that determines whether changes can be made to that cell. The locked property has no impact as long as the worksheet is unprotected. After you protect a worksheet, the locked property controls whether the cell can be edited. Unlock a cell by turning off the locked property. By default, the locked property is turned on for each cell, and worksheet protection is turned off. Unless you unlock cells in a worksheet before protecting the worksheet, all of the cells in the worksheet will be locked, and you won’t be able to make any changes. Usually, you will protect the worksheet but leave some cells unlocked. First, turn off the locked property of cells in which data can be entered. Then, you protect the worksheet to activate the locked property for the remaining cells.

##### Proskills Teamwork: _Assigning Ranges to Users_

><hr>A workbook might be shared among several colleagues. But you might want to assign each colleague a different range to edit. The technique of unlocking cells does not distinguish between one user and another. The cells in a workbook are locked or unlocked for every user.
>
>You can fine-tune access to the contents of a workbook using the Allow Edit Ranges button in the Protect group on the Review tab. This tool lets you define who can edit which ranges when the worksheet is protected. You can even create different passwords for each range. Thus, colleagues in one department can edit one range of data and while workers in another department are limited to a different range.
>
>Editable ranges are a useful tool when you have several groups of employees accessing and editing the workbook. You always want to control who has access to existing data and who has the clearance to enter new data.
