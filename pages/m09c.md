## [](#calculating-interest-rates-with-the-rate-function)Calculating Interest Rates with the RATE function

The pmt, fv, nper, and pv arguments corresponded to Excel functions. The rate argument also has a corresponding RATE function that calculates the interest rate based on the values of the other financial arguments. The RATE function is used primarily to evaluate the return from investments when you know the pv, fv, pmt, and nper values.

The syntax of the [RATE function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/rate-function-9f665657-4a7e-4bb7-a030-83fc59e748ce) is `RATE(nper, pmt, pv, [fv=0], [type=0], [guess=0.1])`

* nper is the number of payments
* pmt is the amount of each payment
* pv is the loan or investment’s present value
* fv is the future value
* type defines when the payments are made
* guess argument (optional) is used when the RATE function cannot calculate the interest rate value and needs an initial guess to arrive at a solution

## [](#viewing-the-payback-period-of-an-investment)Viewing the Payback Period of an Investment

The payback period is the length of time required for an investment to recover its initial cost. It is a simple measure of the return from an investment.

## [](#calculating-net-present-value)Calculating Net Present Value

The payback period is a quick method of assessing the long-term value of an investment but it does not take into account the time value of money

##### The Time Value of Money

The time value of money is based on the observation that money received today is worth more than later. It can be expressed in terms of what represents a fair exchange between current dollars and future dollars. You can use the PV function to calculate the time value of money under different rates of return. And you can use the FV function to estimate how much a dollar amount today is worth in terms of future dollars

A common source of confusion is that the NPV function in Excel does not correspond to the financial definition of net present value. Excel’s NPV function only calculates the present value of a series of cash flows and assumes the initial payment occurs at the end of the first period, not immediately.

##### Using the NPV Function

The PV function assumes that all future payments are equal. If the future payments are not equal, you must use the NPV (net present value) function to determine what would be a fair exchange. The syntax of the [NPV function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/npv-function-8672cb67-2576-4d07-b67b-ac28acf2a568) is: `NPV(rate, value1, [value2, value3, ...])`. The NPV function assumes that payments occur at the end of each payment period and that the payment periods are evenly spaced

##### Choosing a Rate of Return

Risk is the possibility that the entire transaction will fail, resulting in a loss of the initial investment. Investments with higher risks generally should have higher rates of return.

###### Net present value of the investment

## [](#calculating-the-internal-rate-of-return)Calculating the Internal Rate of Return

At some rate of return, the net present value of an investment will change from a positive value to a negative value.

Internal rate of return (IRR)

* Point at which net present value of an investment equals 0
* Popular measure of the value of an investment
* Provides a basis of comparison between two investments

Investments with higher IRRs are usually preferred to those with lower IRRs

##### Using the IRR Function

Use [IRR function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/irr-function-64925eaa-9988-495b-b290-3ad0c163c1bc) to calculate internal rate of return for an investment. The IRR function has the syntax: `IRR(values, [guess=0.1])`. Like the NPV function, it assumes that payments and payoffs occur at evenly spaced intervals. Unlike NPV function, you include the initial cost of the investment in the values list.

##### Proskills Decision Making: _Using NPV and IRR to Compare Investments_

><hr>Investors will always have several investment options. In comparing two investments, investors usually want to select the investment with the higher net present value or the higher internal rate of return. However, if investors rely solely on the net present value, they can receive contradictory results depending on the value specified for the desired rate of return.
>
>For example, consider the following two returns from an initial investment of $1,000\. Option 1 has a higher net present value when discount rates are greater than 9%, while Option 2 has a higher net present value when the discount rate is 9% or less.
>
><hr>

Using the internal rate of return instead of the net present value can also lead to contradictory results. This often occurs when an investment switches several times between positive and negative cash flows during its history. In those situations, more than one internal rate of return value could fit the data.

To choose between two or more investments, it is a good idea to graph the net present value for each investment against different possible rates of return. By comparing the graphs, you can reach a decision about which investment is the most profitable and under what conditions.

##### Exploring the XNPV and XIRR Functions

NPV and IRR functions assume that the cash flows occur at evenly spaced intervals. Use XNPV and XIRR functions for cash flows that appear at unevenly spaced intervals.

The [XNPV function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/xnpv-function-1b42bbf6-370f-4532-a0eb-d67c16b664b7) calculates the net present value of a series of cash flows at specified dates and has the syntax: `XNPV(rate, values, dates)`

The [XIRR function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/xirr-function-de1242ec-6477-445b-b11b-a303ad9adc9d) calculates the internal rate of return for a series of cash flows made at specified dates and has the syntax: `XIRR(values, dates, [guess=0.1])`

## [](#auditing-a-workbook)Auditing a Workbook

A challenge with large and complex workbooks is that the cell values and formulas are interconnected. Changing the value of one cell can alter the value returned by a formula located in a completely different part of the workbook. The source of the error can be unclear at first glance. Excel includes several auditing tools to help you explore the interconnectedness of the cells and formulas in a workbook.

It is important being able to find errors and resolve them before making financial decisions. Two methods for finding errors are the ability to trace an error back to its source and the Watch Window.

##### Tracing an Error

An error could be located in the cell containing the error value, or it could be in a dependent cell or a precedent cell.

* A dependent cell is one whose value depends on the values of other cells in the workbook
* A precedent cell is one whose value is referenced by other cells

A cell can be both a dependent cell and a precedent cell. To locate the source of an error value, you select any cell containing the error value and trace its precedent cells. If any of the precedent cells displays an error value, you need to trace that cell’s precedents and so on until you reach an error cell that has no precedents; that cell is the source of the error values in all of its dependent cells

Tracer arrows

* Provide a visual clue to relationship between two cells
* Point from precedent cell to dependent cell
* A blue tracer arrow indicates that no error has been received or passed
* A red tracer arrow indicates that an error has been received from the precedent cell or passed to the dependent cell

##### Evaluating a Formula

One drawback to using tracer arrows is that they can clutter a worksheet. Sometimes you want to trace only a single formula to its roots. Another way to explore the relationship between cells in a workbook is by evaluating formulas. Use Evaluate Formula dialog box to display the value of different parts of the formula or “drill down” through cell references in the formula to discover the source of formula’s value

###### Error values in the Balance Sheet worksheet
![Figure 9-31 Error values in the Balance Sheet worksheet](../images/modules/M09/Figure%209-31.png)

##### Using the Watch Window

A Watch Window is a window that displays values of cells located throughout the workbook. When you change a cell’s value, a Watch Window allows you to view the impact of the change on widely scattered dependent cells. The window also displays the workbook, worksheet, defined name, cell value, and formula of each cell being watched
