## [](#calculations-with-pivottables)Calculations with PivotTables

PivotTables support the following statistical functions to summarize data within each PivotTable field: Sum, Count, Average, Max, Min, Product, CountNumbers, StdDev, StdDevP, Var, and Varp. Each calculation is done without reference to other fields or items in the PivotTable.

> Tip: A hidden column is not removed from a worksheet but instead is given a width of 0 pixels, effectively hiding it from the user.

## [](#displaying-pivottables-with-conditional-formats)Displaying PivotTables with Conditional Formats

You can apply a conditional format to the following parts of a PivotTable:

*   Selected Cells. The conditional format is applied directly to cells selected from the PivotTable.
*   All Cells Showing a Field Value. The conditional format is associated with a specific field, wherever that field is located within the PivotTable.
*   All Cells Showing Multiple Field Values. The conditional format is applied to cells where multiple fields intersect, such as the cells representing revenue totals from motels in each month.

##### Creating an Icon Set

An icon set is a conditional format in which different icons are displayed in a cell based on the cell’s value. Icon sets are useful for highlighting extreme values or trends in your data.

> Tip: If you need to change or remove an icon in an icon set click the drop-down list arrow next to the icon image.

##### Working with Color Scales

A color scale is a conditional format in which the fill color is based on a range of cell values where cells with larger values are filled with progressively darker (or lighter) shades. The varying shades in the color scale quickly identify the extreme values of the PivotTable field and highlight important trends in the data.

## [](#exploring-the-pivottable-cache)Exploring the PivotTable Cache

The information used to create a PivotTable is stored within a data structure called the PivotTable cache. The cache contains an exact copy of the PivotTable’s data source optimized for size and speed, which makes PivotTables very responsive to changes in content and layout.

##### Sharing a Cache Between PivotTables

A consequence of sharing the same cache is that anything you do in one PivotTable becomes part of the cache and is instantly applied to the other PivotTables.

##### Creating a New Cache

To create a separate cache, you will use a tool that was available in older versions of Excel. Prior to Excel 2016, PivotTables were created using a tool called the PivotTable Wizard.

## [](#working-with-calculated-items-and-calculated-fields)Working with Calculated Items and Calculated Fields

A calculated item is a user-defined formula for calculations between items within a PivotTable field. Where a calculated item performs calculations on items within a field, a calculated field is a user-defined formula for calculations across one or more fields.  
The formulas for calculated items and fields can accept any worksheet function that uses numbers as arguments and returns a numeric value, such as the AVERAGE, SUM, or COUNT functions.

##### Proskills Written Communication: _Documenting PivotTables_

><hr>As PivotTables grow in size and complexity, it is helpful to document your work for others. You should always give PivotTable fields and calculations clear and descriptive names. Choose formats that are appropriate for the type of data you are displaying and apply conditional formats if possible to highlight key features in your tables.
>
>You should document any customized calculations used in a PivotTable somewhere in the workbook. You can create the documentation sheet, or you can have Excel create a list of calculated items and fields by doing the following:
>
> * Select the PivotTable whose calculated items and fields you want to document.
> * On the PivotTable Tools Analyze tab, in the Calculations group, click the Fields, Items, & Sets button, and then click List Formulas.
>
> Excel will create a new worksheet describing all the calculated items and fields, including the name of the items and the fields, the formulas involved, and the solution order. This is a static list, so if you add to or edit your calculated items and fields, you must regenerate the list of formulas. 
><hr>

> Tip: Fields do not have to be displayed in the PivotTable to be accessible to a calculated field formula.
