## [](#using-lookup-functions)Using Lookup Functions

##### Creating Approximate Match Lookups
Exact match lookup occurs when the lookup value must match one of the values in the first column (or row) of the lookup table

> Tip: With each exact match lookup, the data in the first column or row can be placed in any order.

An approximate match lookup is a lookup in which the lookup value is compared to ranges of values rather than a single, specific value. They can reference a vertical or horizontal lookup table. Excel finds an approximate match by going down the first column of the table until it locates the row containing the largest value that is less than or equal to the lookup value. Then it retrieves the corresponding values from that row. An approximate match lookup occurs when the lookup value is found within a range of numbers in the first column (or row) of the lookup table

##### Proskills Problem Solving: _Avoiding Common VLOOKUP Mistakes_
><hr>The VLOOKUP function is one of the most useful and widely applied of the Excel functions. But, it’s also easy to make a mistake using it. Here are some common VLOOKUP errors to avoid:
>
>  *   Forgetting to include a range_lookup value of FALSE for exact match lookups. If you don’t include the range_lookup value, VLOOKUP will assume an approximate match lookup.
>  *   Failing to sort the first column in ascending order for approximate match lookups. VLOOKUP requires that the first column be assorted in ascending order or else you may get an incorrect result.
>  *   Failing to specify the lower end of each range with an approximate match lookup. Always start with the lowest possible compare value in the first row and then build your ranges from there.
>  *   Placing duplicate values in the first column. VLOOKUP requires unique values for both exact and approximate match lookups.
>  *   Using relative references to the lookup table. If you use AutoFill to copy your VLOOKUP formulas, make sure you use an absolute reference or a defined name for the lookup table so that the copied formulas will always reference the lookup table's correct location.
>  *   Failing to revise the table for new data. If you add new columns or new rows to the lookup table, you must edit your VLOOKUP functions accommodate the additional content.
>
> Whenever you use VLOOKUP, take some time to compare your answers to the table, ensuring that you are getting the results you expect. Be sure to try a wide range of lookup values from the lowest possible to the highest. Don’t get caught with an error in your table or in your formula.

##### Using Horizontal Lookup Tables
*   Searches horizontally across top row of table and retrieves the value in the column you specify
*   Use when comparison values are located in the first row of the lookup table and you want to look down a specified number of rows to find the data to enter in another cell
*   Syntax: `HLOOKUP(lookup_value,table_array,row_index_num[,range_lookup])`
*   Major difference between HLOOKUP and VLOOKUP functions is the way lookup tables are organized

##### Performing Partial Lookups with Wildcards
Partial lookups can be helpful when you’re working with large data sets. A partial lookup matches a character pattern rather than a specific value. You use wildcards to create the character pattern for the lookup.

##### Retrieving Data with Index Match Lookups
*   The VLOOKUP function finds data based on values in the first column.
*   The HLOOKUP function finds data based on values in the first row.
*   The MATCH function returns the position of a value found within a row or column.

The syntax of the MATCH function is  
`MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type=1])`

## [](#exploring-logical-functions)Exploring Logical Functions
The Excel family of logical functions is used to set data values based on whether a condition is true or false.

> Tip: Remember that an IF function can choose between only two outcomes. However, a nested IF function can choose from among three or more outcomes.

##### Using the IFS Function
The IFS function tests for multiple conditions without nesting and has the syntax  
`IF(logical_test1, value_if_true1, logical_test2, value_if_true2, …)`

##### Combining Conditions with the OR and AND Functions

##3### OR function nested within an IF function
![Figure 7-12 OR function nested within an IF function](../images/modules/M07/Figure%207-12.png)

The OR function combines multiple conditions, returning a value of TRUE if any of the conditions are true. The AND function returns a value of TRUE if all of the conditions are true.

The two functions have a similar syntax:  
`OR(logical1, [logical2], [logical3], …)`  
`AND(logical1, [logical2], [logical3], …)`

## [](#applying-summary-if-functions)Applying Summary IF Functions

Use COUNTIF, SUMIF, and AVERAGEIF functions to calculate a conditional count, sum, or average using only cells that meet a particular condition

> Tip: Please make sure you understand the differences among the functions and when each should be used. When in doubt, use F1 to open Excel Help and look at the examples.

##### Conditional Counting with COUNTIF
*   Calculates the number of cells in a range that match specified criteria
*   Sometimes referred to as a conditional count
*   Syntax: `COUNTIF(range, criteria)`

###### COUNTIF function applied to the Media table
![Figure 7-14 COUNTIF function applied to the Media table](../images/modules/M07/Figure%207-14.png)

##### Calculating Conditional Sums with SUMIF
*   Adds values in a range that meet your criteria
*   Also called a conditional sum
*   Syntax: `SUMIF(range, criteria[, sum_range])`

##### Calculating Conditional Averages with AVERAGEIF
*   Similar to SUMIF function
*   Calculates the average of values in a range that meet criteria you specify
*   Syntax: `AVERAGEIF(range, criteria[, average_range])`

##### Using Summary IFS Functions
To apply multiple criteria for a conditional count, use the COUNTIFS function  
`COUNTIFS(range1, criteria1, [range2], [criteria2] …)`

The syntax for the SUMIFS function and AVERAGEIFS function are  
`SUMIFS(sum_range, range1, criteria1, [range2], [criteria2] …)`  
`AVERAGEIFS(avg_range, range1, criteria1, [range2], [criteria2] …)`[](#pivottables)
