The tools and techniques used to extract useful information from data is referred to as Business Intelligence (or B I).  
It seeks to answer questions of fact, such as “What happened?” and “When did it happen?” and “Where did it happen?”  
Business Intelligence is often paired with analytics, which seeks answers to strategic planning questions, such as “Why did it happen?” and “How can we make it happen again?”

## [](#writing-a-data-query)Writing a Data Query

Power Query is a BI tool that writes queries for almost any kind of data source, from text files to websites to large data structures. With Power Query, you can specify which parts of the data you want to import and how that data should be formatted. You can even modify the structure of the data prior to bringing it into Excel.

###### Data arranged in a CSV file

Text files are simple, widely used formats for storing raw, unformatted data (text and numbers). It is very useful for sharing data across software programs and computer systems. There two main text file formats:

* Use a delimiter (space, comma, or tab) to separate columns of data.
* Use fixed-width text file to start each column at the same location

Up to now, we have worked with Excel using data that is already in a worksheet, or that we have keyed into a worksheet. But sometimes it is necessary or desirable to bring into an Excel worksheet data from some other source. One possible source of data is a text file. Simply, a text file is a file without formulas, graphics, special fonts, or formatting.

##### Retrieving Data into an Excel Table

Queried data can be imported into an Excel table, PivotTable, or PivotChart. You can also just create a connection to the data source and load the actual data later.

##### Editing a Query

To edit a query, point to that query in the Queries & Connections pane. A dialog box opens, displaying information about the selected query and options for modifying the query.

##### Refreshing Query Data

Loading data from a query into Excel creates a snapshot of that data. To load a query to a different location, click the Load. To button in the Load group on the Query Tools Query tab, and specify a new location in the Import Data dialog box.

Power Query also includes tools to create new columns, group data values, and calculate summary statistics. This capability is particularly useful for large datasets in which the analyst is interested in only overall measures and not individual values.

###### Group By dialog box

##### Grouping Values in a Query

When you create a grouping, Power Query adds a new column that summarizes the numeric values within each group by calculating statistics such as the sum, average, median, minimum, maximum, or count of those values.

## [](#charting-trends)Charting Trends

When examining the relationship between two data fields, such as monthly revenue and date of purchase, analysts often want to find trends in the data. One way to identify a trend is by adding a trendline added to a chart.

Trendline types:

* Exponential
* Linear
* Logarithmic
* Moving Average
* Polynomial
* Power

###### Linear trendline added to a scatter chart

## [](#creating-a-forecast-sheet)Creating a Forecast Sheet

Forecast sheets are another Excel tool used for modeling data and forecasting future values. One advantage of forecast sheets is that they can be used to analyze seasonal data in which the values follow a periodic pattern throughout the calendar year.

###### Create Forecast Worksheet dialog box
![Figure 10-12 Create Forecast Worksheet dialog box](../images/modules/M10/Figure%2010-12.png)

##### To set forecast sheet options.

In the Create Forecast Worksheet dialog box, expand Options. To add a seasonal trend to the forecasts, in the Seasonality group, click the Set Manually option, and then enter the number of periods in one season. To set the confidence interval for the forecasted values, enter a value in the Confidence Interval input box. To set the extent of the forecast, enter the ending date in the Forecast End box.

##### Proskills Teamwork: _Maintaining Data Security_

><hr>Data security is essential for any business to maintain the integrity of its data and retain the trust of its colleagues and customers. It is critical to secure data to prevent lapses in security. If your workbooks are connected to external data sources, keep in mind the following tips:
>
>* Apply data security controls. Make sure your data files are set up with password controls to prohibit unauthorized access.
>* Keep software updated. Be sure to diligently update the software that stores your data with the latest security patches.
>* Closely monitor data copying. Have only one source of your data. When multiple copies of the data exist, data securiconsistency, and integrity are compromised.
>* Encrypt your data. Use data encryption to prevent hackers from gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.
>
>Maintaining data security requires that everyone with access to your data files knows how to retrieve and process that data appropriately. In the end, your data will be only as secure as the work habits of the people who access it.
