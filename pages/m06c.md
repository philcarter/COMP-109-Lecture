##### Creating a Slicer to Filter a PivotTable
*   Another way to filter a PivotTable is with a slicer
*   Can create a slicer for any field in the PivotTable Fields pane
*   The slicer contains a button for each unique value in that field
*   You can format the slicer and its buttons, changing its style, height, and width
*   You can create more than one slicer at a time

## [](#creating-a-dashboard)Creating a Dashboard
A dashboard is a page or screen providing informative visuals of data, key performance indicators, and statistics. Most dashboards contain interactive tools to help users explore data under different conditions and assumptions.

##### Formatting a Slicer

By default, slicer buttons are arranged in a single column. You can increase the number of the columns by formatting the slicer.

##### Creating Dynamic Charts

Charts based on Excel tables are dynamic, which means they update automatically as the source data is filtered so that hidden records do not contribute to the chart's appearance. This dynamic quality makes charts ideal for dashboards, because the users can see visual representations of the data under varying criteria.

##### Looking Up Data with Tables

Excel tables work well as lookup tables for the VLOOKUP function. As you add more records to the lookup table, the VLOOKUP function will automatically include the additional rows. If you filter the data, the lookup table will be restricted only to those rows that match filter criteria. Also, you can use the table name as the lookup table reference rather than referencing a range.

##### Proskills Written Communication: Planning for Data Entry
><hr>A dashboard is designed to tell a story. It can be a springboard to reports providing more in-depth analysis, but fundamentally a dashboard needs to present useful information at a glance. As you create dashboards, keep in mind the following design tips:
>
> *   **Go Big. Go Bold.** Don’t be afraid to use extremely large fonts and bright colors for important results. You want the viewer’s eyes to be attracted to those results first, and you want those results to be remembered.
> *   **Start from the Upper-Left Corner**. Most people read from the top to the bottom and left to right, so put your most important information in the upper-left corner where it will be noticed first.
> *   **Keep It Simple.** Focus on a few key points, and keep the clutter of charts, graphics, and text to a minimum. You can always create additional dashboards.
> *   **Don’t Let Color Overwhelm**. Keep the design of charts and graphics to a few complementary colors and be consistent in their use. Adding too many colors is distracting and reduces the impact of the dashboard.
> *   **Make It Intuitive**. Interactive tools like slicers and drop-down menus should be easy to use. You may not have room to explain how to use the dashboard.
> *   **Be Focused**. Settle on a few key points. If chart or graphic doesn’t relate to that idea, remove it or place it in a different dashboard.
> 
> As you design a dashboard, always keep your audience in mind. What are they looking for? The dashboard you present to a sales director might be very different from one you present to a marketing manager or an HR executive. A dashboard is most useful and has the greatest impact when it is tailored to the needs of your audience.
