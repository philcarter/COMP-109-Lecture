In my opinion this chapter covers the bread and butter aka foundation of spreadsheets: Formulas and Functions! There is a lot to read and digest, but it is not complicated. That comes later! :)

## [](#microsoft-excel-terminology)Microsoft Excel terminology

*   **Constants** — Terms in an equation whose values does not change.
*   **Fill handle** — A black square that appears in the lower-right corner of a selected cell or range; used to fill adjacent cells with duplicate or similar data.
*   **Key Performance Indicator (KPI)** — A measurement used by business to measure achievement of a specific goal.
*   **Central Tendency** — A single measurement from a data series that returns the most typical or “central” data value.
*   **Average** — The sum of the data values divided by the number of values in the data series; also called mean.
*   **Median** — The central value of a data series.
*   **Mode** — The value that is repeated most often in a data set.
*   **Logical Functions** — A function that returns a different value depending on whether the given condition is true or false.
*   **Lookup Functions** — A function that retrieves a value that matches a specified condition from a table of data.
*   **Error Value** A message in a cell that indicates some part of a formula is preventing Excel from returning a calculated value.

## [](#designing-a-workbook-for-calculations)Designing a Workbook for Calculations

A workbook with many calculations can be challenging for us to write and for others to use. To help everyone, it is important to list the formulas used in the workbook and to explain the assumptions behind those formulas. The workbook documentation should also include the definitions of key terms to make it clear what is being calculated and why. Some equations use constants. Make sure that we document those constants, especially if they are inside a formula.

###### There are many benefits to documenting the contents of a workbook

*   Helps to avoid errors and confusion;
*   helpful to explain the formulas and terms used in the calculations;
*   serve as a check that equations are accurate;
*   anyone who needs to enter data in the workbook or interpret its results can understand the workbook's content.

## [](#calculating-with-dates-and-times)Calculating with Dates and Times

Excel stores dates and times as the number of days since January 0, 1900\. Full days are a whole number and partial days are a fraction such as 0.5 for a half day or 12 hours. Storing dates and times as numbers makes it easier to calculate time and date intervals. And when it comes to dates and times, it will not be always easy, especially when we are working with data from outside sources.

## [](#autofilling-formulas-and-data-patterns)AutoFilling Formulas and Data Patterns

One way to efficiently enter long columns or rows of formulas and data values is with AutoFill. AutoFill extends a formula or a pattern of data values into a selected range and is often faster than copying and pasting, which requires two distinct actions on the part of the user. It takes a little practice to understand it, but it will save us a lot of time!

The fill handle is a small black square located in the lower-right corner of a selected cell or range. When I drag the fill handle, Excel automatically fills in the formulas and formats used in the selected cells. This technique is also known as AutoFill. The same rules for relative, absolute, and mixed references apply for AutoFill as do for copy and paste.

After I drag the fill handle, we will notice a small AutoFill Options button appear to the lower right of the selected cell or range.

###### **Exploring Auto Fill Options**

By default, AutoFill extends both the formulas and the formatting of the initial cell or cells. However, you might want to extend only the formulas or only the formatting

###### **Filling a Series**

Use AutoFill to create a series of numbers, dates, or text based on a pattern. To extend a series of data values based on a pattern, enter enough values to establish the pattern, select those cells containing the pattern, and then drag the fill handle extending the pattern into a larger range. Use the Series dialog box for more complex AutoFill patterns.

## [](#applying-excel-functions)Applying Excel Functions

I have added several links to Functions documentation. Start looking up the following functions, which we will start using in this module:  
Here is a list of functions we will be working with in this module:

    SUM(), COUNT(), COUNTA(), AVERGAGE(), ROUND(), ROUNDDOWN(), ROUNDUP(), MROUND(), MAX(), MIN(), MEDIAN(), TODAY(), IF(), IFERROR(), VLOOKUP(), DAY(), DATE(), DATEVALUE(), YEAR(), MONTH(), MINUTE(), SECOND(), NOW()

## [](#date-and-time-functions)Date and Time Functions

Many workbooks include the current date. Use the [TODAY function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/today-function-5eb3078d-a82c-4736-8930-2f51a028fdd9) to display the current date in a worksheet. The date displayed by the TODAY function is updated automatically whenever you reopen the workbook or enter a new calculation.

| Function | Description |
|--------|--------|
| DATE_(year, month, day_) | Creates a date value for the date represented by the _year, month_ and _day_ arguments |
| DAY(_serial_number_) | Extracts the day of the month from a date value stored as _serial_number_ |
| MONTH(_serial_number_ ) | Extracts the month number from a date value stored as serial_number, where 1=January, 2=February, and so on |
| YEAR(_serial_number_ ) | Extracts the 4-digit year value from a date value stored as _serial_number_ |
| NETWORKDAYS_(start_date, end_date, [_holidays]) | Calculates the number of whole working days between _state_date_ and _end_date_; to exclude holidays, add the optional holidays argument containing a list of holiday dates to skip  |
| WEEKDAY_(serial_number, [_return_type]) | Calculates the weekday from a date value stored as _serial_number_, where 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, and so forth; to choose a different numbering scheme, set return_type to 1 (1=Sunday, 2=Monday, …), 2 (1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, …), or 3 (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, …) |
| WORKDAY_(start_date, days,_ [holidays]) | Returns the workday after _days_ workdays have passed since the _start_date_; to exclude holidays, add the optional holidays argument containing a list of holiday dates to skip
| NOW( ) | Returns the current date and time |
| TODAY( ) | Returns the current date |

## [](#interpreting-error-values)Interpreting Error Values

There are actually two kinds of errors in the world of programming: Syntax errors and Logic Errors. The first one is easy to spot: I will receive an Error Message either in clear text or symbols. Most of the time I will Google the error message.

The second type are logic errors. Our spreadsheet may produce bad information, but I will not know it, unless I run our spreadsheet with data where I know the results beforehand. For example I know our margin is 8%. I report a $348 profit on an item which sells for $435\. No error message, but I just used .8 in my report instead of 8% or .08\. Easy to do, but hard to catch when we work with a lot of data with different data.

An error value in an Excel worksheet is a syntax error and it indicates that some part of a formula was entered incorrectly. Error values by themselves might not be particularly descriptive or helpful. To help you locate the error, an error indicator appears in the upper-left corner of the cell with the error value.

| Error Value | Description |
| #DIV/0! | The formula or function contains a number divided by 0. |
| #NAME? | Excel doesn’t recognize text in the formula or function, such as when the function name is misspelled. |
| #N/A | A value is not available to a function or formula, which can occur when a workbook is initially set up prior to entering actual data values. |
| #NULL! | A formula or function requires two cell ranges to intersect, but they don’t. |
| #NUM! | Invalid numbers are used in a formula or function, such as text entered in a function that requires a number. |
| #REF! | A cell reference used in a formula or function is no longer valid, which can occur when the cell used by the function was deleted from the worksheet. |
| #VALUE! | The wrong type of argument is used in a function or formula. This can occur when you reference a text value for an argument that should be strictly numeric. |
