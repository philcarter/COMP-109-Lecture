Please familiarize yourselves with the names of all the parts of the Excel window. These names will be used over and over again throughout the course, so our understanding of key terms such as these will help us to build our knowledge and we will execute assignments with ease.

Now, there will be times, we will be stuck in Excel. We will have three sources of help:

*   Post your questions in the discussion forum. I encourage all of us to read and participate. Do not wait for me to post a reply - Take the initiative, help your fellow student and earn even extra credit. 
*   Google for help. It will a little bit of practice to fine tune our search. I always precede my search with “MS Excel ….”
*   MS Excel has some fantastic help built in with tons of examples. Just hit F1 on your keyboard. Or locate the search bar on top of the excel window. I use the help nearly everytime when I work with functions.

One final piece of advice. The quickest way to interact is via the keyboard. The mouse is very convenient, but it slows you down because you have to move your hand just to get to the mouse. Start learning and using keyboard shortcuts!

## [](#what-is-excel)What is Excel?

So, first we have to explore what a spreadsheet is.

**Spreadsheets** are electronic accounting worksheets, which are documents in which data is laid out in rows and columns - like a big table. It was the killer app that propelled the personal computer industry into our offices and homes. Spreadsheets are applications that track, analyze, and chart numeric information. They are used for business, industry, education, and individuals to make financial decisions.

Now **Microsoft Excel** is a software program included in the Microsoft Office suite. It is used to create electronic spreadsheets, And Excel has grown beyond accounting worksheets, but at its core it is all about numbers, used for calculation, accounting, and charting.

## [](#microsoft-excel-terminology)Microsoft Excel terminology

*   **Workbook** — A spreadsheet program file that you create in Excel. A workbook contains worksheets of rows and columns in which you can enter and calculate data.
*   **Worksheet** — The primary document that you use in Excel to store and work with data. Also called a spreadsheet. A worksheet consists of cells that are organized into columns and rows; a worksheet is always stored in a workbook.
*   **Active Sheet** — The sheet that you’re working on in a workbook. The name on the tab of the active sheet is bold.
*   **Chart Sheet** — A sheet that contains only a chart that is linked to data within the workbook.
*   **Ribbon** — Above the workbook is a section of command tabs called the Ribbon. A multitude of options are found behind each tab of the ribbon
*   **Backstage View** — File tab of the ribbon, contains various screen with commands that allows you to manage files and options for Excel.
*   **Columns** and Rows — Columns and Rows refer to how your cells are aligned. Columns are aligned vertically while rows are aligned horizontally.
*   **Column and Row headings** — These headings are the lettered and numbered gray areas found just outside of columns and rows. Clicking on a heading will select the entire row or column. You can also alter the row height or column width using the headings.
*   **Cell** — A box formed by the intersection of a row and column in a worksheet or a table, in which you enter information.
*   **Cell Reference** — The set of coordinates that a cell occupies on a worksheet. For example, the reference of the cell that appears at the intersection of column B and row 3 is B3.
*   [Cell] **Range** — Two or more cells on a sheet. The cells in a range can be adjacent or nonadjacent
*   **Range Reference** — Includes the cell reference of the upper-left cell of a range block and the cell reference of the lower-right cell of that same block separated by a colon.
*   **Template** — A template is a formatted workbook or worksheet designed to help users fulfill a specific need in Excel. Examples of this include stock analysis, process map, and calendar.
*   **Operator** — Operators are symbols or signs that indicate which calculation must be made in an expression. Operators do not necessarily refer to simple mathematical types; comparison, text concatenation or reference operators also exist.
*   **Formula** — A sequence of values, cell references, names, functions, or operators in a cell that together produce a new value. A formula always begins with an equal sign (=)..
*   **Function** — A function is a predefined, or built-in, formula for a commonly used calculation. It takes a value or values, performs an operation, and returns a value or values. Use functions to simplify and shorten formulas on a worksheet, especially those that perform lengthy or complex calculations
*   **AutoFill** — This enables you to effortless copy data to more than one cell.

## [](#planning-a-workbook)Planning a Workbook

Traditional approach to software development is to gather all requirements at the start of a project, and after review and discussions implement them and then deliver the final product. But that is not how most complex spreadsheets are implemented or used in the real world these days. Requirements and therefore spreadsheets constantly change and evolve. Do not wait until all requirements are know. Start when we have enough to create a minimum viable product.

Tip: Here is two words we have to delete from our vocabulary in the world of software: ALWAYS and NEVER. (Think about it: Things will ALWAYS stay the same, and it will NEVER change)

Now about the actual planning: I think we need to know three things before we start a entering our first number. Think about the purpose of a spreadsheet. Yes, it collects and organizes numbers, and other data, but WHY?

**To answer a question!**

*   What was our profit last quarter?
*   What are the projected earnings next year?
*   How many Nike Shoes did we sell compared to Addidas?

So, in plannning a worksheet, keep these 4 steps in our mind:

1.  What question(s) needs to be answered? What is the information needed?
2.  What data sources will we be working with?
3.  Who the intended audience is? (A spreadsheet for myself will look and be organized totally different then a spreadsheet for my Vice-President)
4.  KISS: Keep It Simple and Stupid. My spreadsheet should be easy to maintain, upgrade and/or modify. Resist the urge of creating a magnum opus!

Time to think of some examples where a workbook would be beneficial ( for example, to keep track of income for fund drive for your student club. Or how about my personal finance to keep track of my expenses each month)

Think of one example and then prepare a list of questions that need to be answered with the workbook. Share the your findings in the discussion forum!

## [](#entering-text-dates-and-numbers)Entering Text, Dates, and Numbers

There are three basic general categories for data: text, numbers, and dates and times. Text data is a combination of letters, numbers, and some symbols. Numeric data is any number that can be used in a mathematical calculation. Date and time data are commonly recognized formats for date and time values. By default, text is left-aligned in cells, whereas numbers, dates, and times are right-aligned.

Tip: Just because an entry looks like a number, for example like SSN or a phone number, it is not a number, but text! Numbers are used for calculations only.

Excel will automatically change some dates into a default date format. For example, if I enter the date “June 4, 2020” Excel will change the date to “4-June-20.” If I enter the date using a two-digit year value such as “6/4/20” Excel will change the date to “6/4/2020.” Excel refers to these date formats as short dates. 

Here are some questions:

*   How should Excel categorize telephone numbers: as text, numbers, or dates and times? Why? 
*   How should Excel identify social security numbers? Why?
*   How should Excel categorize dates like April 15, 2017? Why?

## [](#calculating-with-formulas)Calculating with Formulas

![Session 1.2 Visual Overview: Excel Formulas and Functions](../images/modules/M01/session1-2.png)

When working with formulas I have to begin with an = sign. This lets Excel know that the data is available for calculations.

It is very important that we understand the kinds of operations used in worksheets. In addition, the order of operations is very important. we should understand that if I don't follow the rules of  _Order of Operations_, I could receive unexpected results.

**Never Use Fixed Numbers In Formulas**  
We have all seen "magic numbers" like this `=SUM(A1:A4)***0.123**`. However, the use of fixed or hard-coded numbers is a bad idea. A future user will not know where the number came from, and fixed numbers don't change automatically, and thus might be overlooked when a change is made.

## [](#calculating-with-functions)Calculating with Functions

Each Excel function has a name and syntax. The syntax specifies the order in which I must enter the different parts of the function and the location in which I must insert commas, parentheses, and other punctuation.

The AutoSum feature allows me to quickly enter a sum in a cell. Now the SUM() function is the most widely used function and the AutoSum allows us to automate the process. When I choose the AutoSum feature, Excel will "guess" which cells should be included in the sum. Do not rely on that guess; always double check that the AutoSum range is really the range that we want.

Here is are examples of a formula and a function

This is a formula:

    =A1+B1+C1

And here is the syntax for two functions:

    =SUM(A1:C1)
    =SUM(A1,D1)

The first one is used to sum a range. And the second is used to add cells that are not connected.

**Note**: `=SUM(A1+B1+C1)` is an incorrect syntax for a function, because I am passing the total as an argument to the function. That is the same as passing the number 12 as the sole argument to SUM(). There is nothing for the function to do. Yes, it will provide the correct result in this case, but it may also produce wrong results in other cases.

*   Google for help. It will a little bit of practice to fine tune our search. I always precede my search with “MS Excel ….”
*   MS Excel has some fantastic help built in with tons of examples. Just hit F1 on your keyboard. Or locate the search bar on top of the excel window. I use the help nearly everytime when I work with functions.

One final piece of advice. The quickest way to interact is via the keyboard. The mouse is very convenient, but it slows you down because you have to move your hand just to get to the mouse. Start learning and using keyboard shortcuts!

    =SUM(A1:C1)
