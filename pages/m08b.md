Create scenarios to perform a what-if analysis with more than two input cells. A scenario is a defined set of values for different cells grouped under a common name.

To perform what-if analyses with more than two input variables, you have to use scenarios. A scenario is a set of input values used to perform a what-if analysis. In Excel, you use the Scenario Manager to set up and view different scenarios.

##### Create scenarios using the Scenario Manager

Lets you define input values within a named scenario and quickly switch from one to the other. It can be used to create summary reports.

Before using the Scenario Manager, define names for all input and result cells that you intend to use in the analysis. The defined names automatically appear in reports generated by the Scenario Manager. Using defined names makes it easier to work with scenarios and understand the scenario reports

##### Defining a Scenario

Each scenario includes a scenario name, input cells, and values for each input cell. The number of scenarios is limited only by computer’s memory.

###### Edit Scenario dialog box

Input cells are referred to as “changing cells”

* Contain values that are changed under the scenario
* Can be located anywhere in the worksheet

##### Viewing Scenarios

View the effect of each scenario by selecting it in the Scenario Manager dialog box. Switch from one scenario to another by clicking the Show button in the Scenario Manager dialog box. Excel automatically changes the values of the input cells to match the scenario.

Editing a Scenario by editing the assumptions to view other possible outcomes. The worksheet calculations are automatically updated to reflect the new scenario.

## [](#creating-scenario-summary-reports)Creating Scenario Summary Reports

Create a report either as an Excel table or as an Excel PivotTable to compare the results from multiple scenarios on a single worksheet. To create a scenario summary report, you must identify which result cells you want to include in the report. The scenario summary report displays the values of the input cells and result cells under each scenario

> Tip: By using the Scenario Manager, you can display a summary of the results from all of the scenarios you have created. This data can be displayed in a summary table or a PivotTable

* Each scenario is listed by name
* The current worksheet values are also displayed
* The report used the defined names you created

###### Scenario summary report
![Figure 8-27 Scenario summary report](../images/modules/M08/Figure%208-27.png)

A Scenario PivotTable report displays results from each scenario as a PivotTable field in a PivotTable. These Scenario PivotTable reports are created through the Scenario Manager used to create a summary report. You can edit the scenario PivotTable to make it easier to read. Results for a scenario PivotTable can be displayed in a PivotChart

><hr> In many businesses, several workbooks often track the same set of figures and evaluate the same set of scenarios. Colleagues can share scenarios by merging the scenarios from multiple workbooks into one workbook. The Scenario Manager dialog box includes a Merge button that you can use to merge scenarios from different workbooks. The scenarios will be merged into the active sheet, so they can be compared within a single document. It’s easier to merge scenarios if all the what-if analyses on the different worksheets and workbooks are identical. All the changing cells from the merged scenario must correspond to changing cells in the active workbook and worksheet.
> 
> Once the scenarios are merged, they can be analyzed using a Scenario PivotTable report. One of the advantages of the Scenario PivotTable report over the Scenario Summary report is that you can use it with merged scenarios created by different users. For example, each member of the financial analysis team might propose different numbers for the various scenarios being considered. A Scenario PivotTable report can filter the four scenarios by user or show the average results across all users, giving the team a broader understanding of the various financial scenarios.

> By sharing and merging scenarios, the team can more easily explore the impact of different financial situations, ensuring that everyone is always working from a common set of assumptions and goals.
