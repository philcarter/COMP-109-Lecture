## [](#optimizing-a-product-mix)Optimizing a Product Mix

The combination of products offered by a company is known as the company’s product mix. Products differ in their sales price, production costs, and attractiveness to consumers. A company might find that it is more profitable to devote more of its resources to selling one product over another. Goal is to maximize profits while meeting the demands of the market. The optimal product mix is the product mix that will result in the most profit for the company

Different product mixes result in lower or higher profit for the company. The best way to find the optimal product mix usually isn’t obvious; there are too many possible combinations. To find the one product mix that results in the maximum net profit for the company, you can use Solver

## [](#finding-the-optimal-solution-with-solver)Finding the Optimal Solution with Solver

Solver finds the numeric solution to a problem involving several input values. Solver is an add-in—a program that adds customized commands and features to Microsoft Office programs  
It might need to be activated before you can use it

Solver can:

*   Be used to find the combination of input values that maximizes profits
*   Be used to find a set of input values that minimizes costs
*   Act like Goal Seek and find the input values required to match a given result

It is likely that some of you are wondering how Solver works. It is designed to use an iterative process. That is, it starts with an initial solution, and then does the problem over and over, using different values in the changing variables. When a change to a variable results in a better solution, Solver makes another change to the same variable in the same direction. When a change results in a worse solution, Solver does not make any more changes to that variable in that direction. Solver continues to make changes and re-run the problem, until it arrives at a solution that is not significantly better than the previous one. At that point, Solver reports success

##### Setting the Objective Cell and Variable Cells

Every Solver model needs an objective cell and one or more variable cells  
An objective cell is a result cell that is maximized, minimized, or set to a specific value. A variable cell is an input cell that changes so that the objective cell can meet its defined goal

Almost every Solver model needs one or more constraints. A constraint is a limit that is placed on the solution. Solver supports six types of constraints

## [](#exploring-the-iterative-process)Exploring the Iterative Process

Solver arrives at optimal solutions through an iterative process, in which Solver starts with an initial solution and uses that as a basis to calculate a new solution. Itf refers to the overall highpoint as the global optimum while a nearby high point is the local optimum.

Solver also supports the following iterative methods:

*   Simplex LP method
*   GRG Nonlinear method
*   Evolutionary method

## [](#creating-a-solver-answer-report)Creating a Solver Answer Report

Solver can create three different reports  
**Answer report** summarizes the results of a successful solution by displaying information about the objective cell, changing cells, and constraints. **Sensitivity report** and **limits report** are often used in science and engineering to investigate the mathematical aspects of the Solver solution; these reports allow you to quantify the reliability of the solution

###### Solver Results dialog box with the answer report selected
![Figure 8-43 Solver Results dialog box with the answer report selected](../images/modules/M08/Figure%208-43.png)

The answer report is divided into the following sections:  
Title

*   Solver Engine
*   Solver Options
*   Objective Cell
*   Variable Cells
*   Constraints

The status of each constraint is listed as either Binding or Not Binding. A binding constraint must be included in the Solver model and is a limiting factor in arriving at the solution. A nonbinding constraint does not need to be included as part of the Solver model. The Constraints section also shows the slack for each constraint; the slack is the difference between the value in the cell and the value at the limit of the constraint

##### Proskills Decision Making: _Choosing a What-If Analysis Tool_

> <hr>Part of performing an effective what-if analysis is deciding which what-if analysis tool to use. Each tool has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Data tables are best used when you want to perform several what-if analyses involving one or two input cells and you need to display the analysis in a tabular format. Data tables can also be easily displayed as charts, providing a visual picture of the relationship between the input values and the result values. For what-if analyses involving more than two input cells, you must create a scenario. Scenario summary tables and scenario PivotTables can be used to obtain a quick snapshot of several possible outcomes, and scenarios can be merged and shared among several workbooks. Data tables and scenarios can provide a lot of information, but they cannot easily deliver a single solution or "best outcome." If you need to maximize or minimize a value, you must use Solver. You can also use Solver to set a calculated cell to a specific value. However, if you don't need to specify any constraints on your solution, it is generally quicker and easier to use Goal Seek.

## [](#saving-and-loading-solver-models)Saving and Loading Solver Models

###### Saved Solver model
![Figure 8-45 Saved Solver model](../images/modules/M08/Figure%208-45.png)

You can apply several Solver models to the same data. You can store the Solver parameters for a model in worksheet cells that you can later retrieve and use to rerun that Solver model. By saving the Solver model parameters to cells on the worksheet, you can create as many models as you need to effectively analyze the data. You can then load and apply these different models to your analysis as new data is entered
