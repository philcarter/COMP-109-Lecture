## [](#understanding-cost-volume-relationships)Understanding Cost-Volume Relationships

Cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis studies the relationship between expenses, sales volume, and profitability. It helps predict the effect of cutting overhead or raising prices on a company’s net income

In other words, a CVP analysis shows the relationship between a business’s expenses, volume of business, and profit. It shows how much volume the business needs to break even, given the expenses that the business incurs. It also shows what happens to the profit if the volume of business increases above the break-even point, or decreases below the break-even point.

##### Types of expenses

* **Variable expenses** change in proportion to the amount of business a company does
* **Fixed expense** must be paid regardless of sales volume
* **Mixed expense** is part variable and part fixed

##### Exploring the Break-Even Point

The point where total revenue equals total expenses is called the break-even point. When sales are above the break-even point, a company profits and when sales are below the break even point, a company loses money. CVP analysis is sometimes called break-even analysis. A CVP chart shows the relationship between total expenses and total revenue; the break-even point occurs where the two lines cross

##### Finding the Break-Even Point with What-if Analysis

What-if Analysis lets you explore the impact of changing different values in a worksheet. It can be used to explore the impact of changing financial conditions on a company’s profitability.

One way of finding the break-even point is to use Goal Seek, but a more efficient approach is to use a data table

## [](#working-with-data-tables)Working with Data Tables

A data table is an Excel table that displays the results from several what-if analyses. The table consists of input cells and result cells.

* Input cells are the cells whose value would be changed in a what-if analysis
* Result cells are cells whose values are impacted by the changing input values

You can use one-variable data tables and two-variable data tables

Doing multiple what-if analyses is time-consuming and tedious if you do it by hand. Even if you have an Excel spreadsheet set up to do the calculations, you can only calculate the results for one input variable at a time. However, you should know that, in Excel, you can set up a data table to display the results of several input values. That is, you can ask Excel to do multiple what-if analyses, and display the results in a table.

##### Creating a One-Variable Data Table

Specify one input cell and any number of result cells. The range of possible values for the input cell is entered in the first row or column of the data table; the corresponding result values appear in the subsequent rows or columns. One-Variable Data Table are useful in business to explore how changing a single input cell can impact several financial results.

###### One-variable data table example
![Figure 8-7 One-variable data table example](../images/modules/M08/Figure%208-7.png)

Identify the result value cell based on input values

* The row input cell is used when the input values have been placed in the first row of the data table
* The column input cell is used when the input values are placed in the data table’s first column

##### Charting a One-Variable Data Table

The chart gives a better picture of the relationship between sales volume, revenue, and expenses.

##### Modifying a Data Table

Data tables are dynamic; changes in the worksheet are automatically reflected in the data table values. This includes changes to cells that are not part of the data table but are involved in the values displayed in the result cells

## [](#creating-a-two-variable-data-table)Creating a Two-Variable Data Table

Two-Variable Data Table lets you view the relationship between two input cells, but it can display only a single result value. But you can analyze a variety of combinations simultaneously.

Sometimes you want to see what would happen if you vary two inputs, instead of just one. Excel provides the capability to create two-variable data tables, which allow two input variables and one result variable. The data table will have the values for one input variable across the top row of the table, and the values for the other input variable down the first column.

###### Two-variable data table example

##### Formatting the Result Cell

You can hide a cell value using the custom format “text”, where text is the text you want to display in place of the cell value.

##### Charting a Two-Variable Data Table

You can chart the values from a two-variable data table using lines to represent the different columns of the table.
