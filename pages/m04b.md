## [](#creating-a-scatter-chart)Creating a Scatter chart
Scatter charts in Excel (also known as XY scatter plot charts) are excellent for showing correlations between two sets of values. For example an XY scatter plot can be used to illustrate the correlation between employee performance and competency, demonstrating that employee performance rises as competency improves. The x and y axes work together to represent data plots on the chart based on the intersection of x values and y values.

Scatter charts are widely used in science and engineering applications when investigators want to discover how two numeric variables are related. Scatter charts comparing rates to volatility are usually centered at a point representing a balance between the two.

###### To modify a Chart’s Data Source

- Click the chart to select it
- On the Chart Tools Design tab, in the Data group, click the Select Data button
- In the Legend Entries (Series) section click the Add button or the Remove button
- Click the Edit button in the Horizontal (Category) Axis Labels section to select the category values for the chart

## [](#adding-graphic-objects-to-a-workbook)Adding Graphic Objects to a Workbook
Excel supports a large gallery of clip art and icons to supplement your charts and worksheet data. One graphic feature you can add to charts is a data callout, which is a label that appears as a text bubble attached to a data marker. Microsoft Office supports a gallery of over 160 shapes that can be added to any workbook or other Office document. The shape gallery includes rectangles, circles, arrows, stars, flow chart symbols, and text boxes. Each shape can be resized and formatted with a wide selection of colors, line styles, and special effects.

Graphic icons, another type of graphic object supported by Microsoft Office, are common symbols often found in signs and posters. For precise placement of objects, Excel provides commands to align graphics within a row or column, distribute them evenly across a horizontal or vertical space, or stack graphics on top of each other. You can also group images together, creating new classes of graphic objects.

##### Hierarchical Charts
Hierarchy charts are like pie charts in that they show the relative contribution of groups to a whole. Unlike pie charts, a hierarchy chart also shows the organizational structure of the data with subcategories displayed within main categories.  

##### Pareto Charts
A special kind of combination chart is the Pareto chart, which combines a column chart and a line chart to indicate which factors are the largest contributors to the whole.

##### Histogram Charts
A histogram is a column chart displaying the distribution of values from a single data series.

##### Waterfall Charts
A waterfall chart tracks the addition and subtraction of values within a sum.

###### Treemap and Sunburst charts

## [](#creating-data-bars)Creating Data Bars
Data Bars is a conditional format that adds a horizontal bar to background of a cell containing a number. The length is based on the value of each cell in the range. It is dynamic: the lengths of data bars automatically update if cell's value changes.You modify a rule by altering the rules of the conditional format.

## [](#creating-sparklines)Creating Sparklines
![Sparklines](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4033/4613105285_afacb4f421.jpg)

There are three types of sparklines. A line sparkline is used for highlighting trends, a column sparkline is used for column charts, and a win/loss sparkline highlights positive and negative values. It's main purpose to limit the amount of noise a traditional chart may create and just focuses on the signal. There is an excellent Insight article in the textbook regarding this topic called “Edward Tufte and Chart Design Theory”

A sparkline is a chart that is displayed entirely within a worksheet cell. Sparklines are compact in size; don't include chart elements (legends, titles, or gridlines). The goal of a sparkline is to convey the maximum amount of information within a very small space. They are useful when you don't want charts to overwhelm the rest of your worksheet or take up valuable page space.

##### Proskills _Written Communication: Honesty in Charting_
> <hr>This module started with the adage that "a picture is worth a thousand words" and will end with another adage: "looks can be deceiving." One of the great challenges in chart design is to not mislead your audience by misrepresenting the data. Here are a few of the ways in which a chart, created even with the best of intentions, can mislead the viewer:
> 
> *   **Improper scaling.** This is a very common mistake in which the range of the data scale is set so narrow that even small changes seem large or so wide that all values appear to be the same. For example, a 1% change in a data value will appear large if the scale goes from 0% to 2% and it will appear insignificant if the scale goes from 0% to 100%.
> 
> *   **Scaling data values differently.** If improper scaling can exaggerate or minimize differences, the problem can be compounded with combination charts in which two data series that should be plotted on the same scale are instead plotted against vastly different scales. For example, one data series might appear to show a significant trend while the other shows none and yet the only difference is the scale on which the values have been plotted.
> 
> *   **Truncating the vertical axis.** You can make trends appear more significant than they are if you cut off what might appear to be irrelevant information. Is an increase in the interest rate from 4% to 4.05% a significant jump? If you set the scale of the vertical axis to cover the range from 0% to 4.1% it will not appear to be. However, if your chart only covers the range from 4% to 4.1% it will appear to be significant jump.
> 
> *   **3-D distortions**. Displaying charts in 3D can be eye-catching, but the effect of perspective in which objects appear to recede into the distance can exaggerate or minimize important differences that would be more apparent with a simple 2D chart. 
> 
> To be fair, one should not assume that a misleading chart was designed with malicious intent. Because Excel and other software packages make charting easy, they also make it easy to create the kinds of mistakes discussed above. To avoid misleading the audience, check your assumptions and verify that you are not altering your chart to make it appear more dramatic or interesting. View your charts under different formatting options to confirm that it is truly the data that is telling the story.
