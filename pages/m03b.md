## [](#calculating-running-totals-with-the-quick-analysis-tool)Calculating Running Totals with the Quick Analysis Tool

The Quick Analysis tool appears whenever you select a range of cells, providing easy access to the most common tools for data analysis, chart creation, and data formatting. It is an excellent tool for doing useful calculations and entering Excel functions.

## [](#exploring-cell-references)Exploring Cell References

Many of us have a difficult time knowing when and how to use relative, absolute, and mixed references. Mastering this skill will help us to create useful worksheets quickly that also yield the correct results. Applying this concept incorrectly can cause a great deal of error.(Logic Error) Remember it is always important to check our results to see if they make sense. Spend time covering each reference type and when each would be used.

A relative reference is a cell reference that shifts when I copy it to a new location on a worksheet. It changes in relation to the change of location.

_To enter a relative reference, type the cell reference as it appears in the worksheet. For example, enter B2 for cell B2. _

An absolute reference is a cell reference that does not change when I copy the formula to a new location. To create an absolute reference, I preface the column and row designations with a dollar sign ($).

_To enter an absolute reference, type $ (a dollar sign) before both the row and column references. For example, enter $B$2._

A mixed reference is a cell reference that contains both relative and absolute references.

_To enter a mixed reference, type $ before either the row or column reference. For example, enter $B2 or B$2._

I can switch among absolute, relative, and mixed references in a formula when in editing mode or on the formula bar by selecting the cell reference in my formula and then pressing the F4 key repeatedly to toggle through the reference options.

Formulas that involve several layers of nesting functions can be difficult to work with. I can explore how to work with nested functions by using the Evaluate Formula button on the Formula Auditing group of the Formulas tab.

Part of writing effective formulas is knowing when to use relative and absolute references. Use relative references when we want to repeat the same formula with different cells. For example, in a customer order worksheet, I might need to calculate the cost of an item multiplied by the quantity being purchased. To repeat this formula for all of the items in an order, I would use relative references for the item cost and item quantity. Use absolute references when we want different formulas to refer to the same cell. For example, in a customer order worksheet, I might need to apply the same sales tax percentage to each order. I could store the sales tax percentage in a worksheet cell, and then use an absolute reference to that cell in the formula that multiplies the order total with the sales tax.

## [](#entering-an-absolute-cell-reference)Entering an Absolute Cell Reference

You can easily cycle between relative, absolute, and mixed cell references in formulas by selecting the cell reference in the formula and pressing F4 while in Edit mode.

##### Proskills Problem Solving:  _When to Use Relative, Absolute, and Mixed Cell References_
> <hr>Part of effective workbook design is knowing when to use relative, absolute, and mixed cell references. 
> 
> Use relative references when you want to apply the same formula with input cells that share a common layout or pattern. Relative references are commonly used when copying a formula that calculates summary statistics across columns or rows of data values. 
> 
> Use absolute references when you want your copied formulas to always refer to the same cell. This usually occurs when a cell contains a constant value, such as a tax rate, that will be referenced in formulas throughout the worksheet. 
> 
> Mixed references are seldom used other than when creating tables of calculated values such as a multiplication table in which the values of the formula or function can be found at the intersection of the rows and columns of the table.<hr>

## [](#working-with-the-if-logical-function)Working with the IF Logical Function

A function that determines whether a condition is true or false is called a logical function. A very common function is the IF function, which uses a logical test to determine whether or not an expression is true or false, and then returns one value if true or another value if false. The logical test is constructed using a comparison operator, which compares two expressions to determine if they are equal, not equal, if one is greater than the other, and so forth. The comparison operators are =, >, <, >=, <=, and lastly <>. Remember we can also make comparisons with text strings and also that we must enclose text strings within double quotation marks.

## [](#formatting-input-calculated-and-output-values)Formatting Input, Calculated, and Output Values

Formatting cells based on their purpose helps others correctly use and interpret your worksheet. The Cell Styles gallery includes cell styles to format cells containing input, calculation, and output values.

## [](#looking-up-data)Looking Up Data

Lookup functions find values in tables of data and insert them in another location in the worksheet such as cells or in formulas.

*   An exact match lookup is when the lookup value must match one of the compare values in the first column of the lookup table
*   An approximate match lookup occurs when the lookup value falls within a range of numbers in the first column of the lookup table

To retrieve a return value from a vertical lookup table, you use the [VLOOKUP function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vlookup-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1).

## [](#performing-what-if-analyses-with-formulas-and-functions)Performing What-If Analyses with Formulas and Functions

A what-if analysis lets you explore the impact that changing input values has on calculated values and output values. One way to perform a what-if analysis is by changing one or more of the input values to see how they affect the calculated results.

The trial-and-error method requires some guesswork as you estimate which values to change and by how much.

To perform a what-if analysis by trial and error:

*   Change the value of a worksheet cell (the input cell)
*   Observe its impact on one or more calculated cells (the result cells)
*   Repeat until the desired results are achieved

## [](#using-goal-seek)Using Goal Seek

Goal Seek automates the trial-and-error process by specifying a value for a calculated item.

To perform a what-if analysis using Goal Seek:

*   On the Data tab, in the Forecast group, click the What-If Analysis button, and then click Goal Seek
*   Select the result cell in the Set cell box, and then specify its value (goal) in the To value box
*   In the By changing cell box, specify the input cell
*   Click OK. The value of the input cell changes to set the value of the result cell.
