## [](#simplifying-formulas-with-named-ranges)Simplifying Formulas with Named Ranges
A named range can refer to any cell or cell range within the workbook, so you can replace a reference such as Sheet1!B7:B43 with the more descriptive name SalesData2021.

##### Defining a Named Range
The simplest way to define a named range is to select a range and enter the name in the Name box. By default, Excel treats named ranges as absolute cell references

##### Using Named Ranges in Formulas
A named range can be used in place of a cell reference in any Excel formula or function. So, the 3-D reference in the formula `=SUM('Sales Data'!E4:E20)` can be replaced with `=SUM(salesFigures)`

##### Determining the Scope of Named Ranges
Local scope is used to avoid name conflicts that would occur when the same name is duplicated across multiple worksheets

##### Using Defined Names in Existing Formulas
Once you have defined a named range, you can have Excel replace all cell references in formulas and functions with the equivalent name

##### Proskills Written Communication: _Saving Time with Defined Names_
> <hr> Words can be more descriptive than numbers. This is especially true with cell references. Compared to the letter and number references for cells, a named range provides a more intuitive reference, which is increasingly important as the workbook becomes longer and more complex. Other advantages of named ranges are:
> 
> * Names such as TaxRate and TotalSales are more descriptive than cell references and are easier to remember and apply.
> * Names in formulas clearly show users exactly what is being calculated. For example, a formula like `=GrossPay&ndash`;Deductions is more easily interpreted than `=C15–C16`.
> * Names remain associated with their range. If a range is moved within the workbook, its name moves with it. Any formulas that contain the name automatically reference the new location.
> * Named ranges operate like absolute cell references. If a formula containing a named range is moved or copied, the reference remains pointed to the correct range.Using defined names saves time and gives everyone reviewing the worksheet a clearer understanding of what that worksheet is doing and what the results mean.

## [](#exploring-workbook-templates)Exploring Workbook Templates
In business, people often create workbooks that have common elements such as invoices, an expense statement, a balance sheet, or many other day-to-day operations workbooks. Using a template makes this process much easier because the elements are already in place and all students do is fill them in. A custom template is a workbook template you or I create that is ready to run with the formulas for all calculations included as well as all formatting.

##### Setting Up a Workbook Template
Any workbook can be turned into a template by just deleting all of the current data, leaving only the formulas and design elements. The data is left blank for end users to fill in at a later date when they start creating their own documents.

##### Proskills Teamwork: _Using Excel Templates_
><hr>A team working together will often need to create the same types of workbooks. Rather than each person or group designing a different workbook, each team member should create a workbook from the same template. The completed workbooks will then all have the same structure with identical formatting and formulas. Not only does this ensure consistency and accuracy, it also makes it easier to compile and summarize the results. Templates help teams work better together and avoid misunderstandings.For example, a large organization may need to collect the same information from several regions. By creating and distributing a workbook template, each region knows what data to track and where to enter it. The template already includes the formulas, so the results are calculated consistently.The following are just some of the advantages of using a template to create multiple workbooks with the same features:
>
> * Templates save time and ensure consistency in the design and content of workbooks because all labels, formatting, and formulas are entered once.
> * Templates ensure accuracy because formulas can be entered and verified once, and then used with confidence in all workbooks.Templates standardize the appearance and content of workbooks.
> * Templates prevent data from being overwritten when an existing workbook is inadvertently saved with new data rather than saved as a new workbook.
> 
> If you are part of a team that needs to create the same type of workbook repeatedly, it’s a good idea to use a template to both save time and ensure consistency in the design and content of the workbooks.
