## [](#working-with-multiple-worksheets)Working with Multiple Worksheets
A workbook can contain one or several worksheets. This feature gives us the ability to organize our data better. Many times a workbook has a massive amount of data. By dividing that data up into worksheets it is much more manageable and accessible. Often times, a worksheet at the front of the workbook will summarize the data on the rest of the worksheets. This provides an opportunity to view summarized data without having to look at the rest of the data unless you want to.

##### Copying Worksheets
Use an existing worksheet as a starting point for creating another one. This duplicates all values, formulas, and formats into new worksheet, leaving the original worksheet intact. Then edit, reformat, and enter new content as needed.

> Tip: The fastest way to copy an entire worksheet or worksheet group is to press and hold the Ctrl key as I drag and drop the sheet tab to another location in the workbook. A number in parentheses is added to the copy’s sheet tab to distinguish it from the original worksheet.

## [](#working-with-worksheet-groups)Working with Worksheet Groups
A worksheet group is a collection of two or more worksheets. Sometimes we will want to work with the worksheets within a workbook as if they were a single unit. Worksheets can be combined together into a group. Grouping worksheets allows us to apply formulas across the worksheets in the group. I can also apply formatting across worksheets in a group. This can allow me to work more efficiently by allowing me to make multiple changes through a single change.

You can edit several worksheets simultaneously by grouping the worksheets. In a worksheet group, any changes made to one worksheet are automatically applied to all sheets in the group

Same page layout settings apply to all worksheets in the group at the same time. All worksheets in the group can be printed at once

Make sure you understand that when we group worksheets, any changes made to one worksheet will also be changed in any other worksheets in the group. This is a great way to apply formatting across worksheets. However, a common error is to delete a value or change a value in a worksheet not intending to have that change made in all the worksheets.So, remember to remove the grouping before you begin to make individual worksheet changes.

## [](#writing-3-d-references)Writing 3-D References
We all now familiar with the two-dimensional aspect of a worksheet (i.e., rows and columns). Think of the collection of worksheets in a workbook as a third dimension. We know that we can reference rows and columns in a worksheet, and can also reference cells in other worksheets. I can, therefore, have a reference in a worksheet that pertains to a cell in another worksheet.  
Also, 3-D cell references can be used within any Excel formula and function

> Tip: You can create flexible 3-D references by using wildcards.

###### 3-D reference in the SUM function

##### Proskills Problem Solving: _Managing 3-D Group References_
><hr>Worksheet group references are based on the current order of worksheets in the workbook. Rearranging the worksheets will affect what values are included in the calculation. Here are some tips to keep in mind when you revised the structure of a workbook containing a reference to a worksheet group:If you insert a new sheet between the first and last sheets of the group, it automatically becomes part of the worksheet group reference.
>
> *   If you move a worksheet out from between the first and last sheets, it is no longer part of the worksheet group reference.
> *   If you move the positions of the first or last sheets, the worksheet group will automatically refer to the new position of the group within the workbook.
> *   If the first sheet in the group is deleted, the sheet to the right of the first sheet becomes the new first sheet in the worksheet group reference.
> *   If the last sheet in the group is deleted, the sheet to the left of the last sheet becomes the new last sheet in the worksheet group reference.
> 
> Keep in mind that relative references within the worksheets will not update if you change the structure of the sheets. For example, if you insert a new column B in the Jan through May worksheets, which moves cell B10 to cell C10 in those sheets, the formula remains `=SUM(Jan:May!B10)`. It's a good practice to use formulas that include a worksheet group reference only when you are confident that the sheet order and the row/column structure of the worksheets within the group will not change.
