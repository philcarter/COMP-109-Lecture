The Developer tab is not displayed by default, so you will first have to add the tab to the Excel ribbon.

## [](#automating-tasks-with-macros)Automating Tasks with Macros

Macros automate any task you perform repeatedly. They perform repetitive tasks consistently and faster than you can. After the macro is created and tested, you can be assured the tasks are done exactly the same way each time. To create and run macros, you need to use the Developer tab

You can create an Excel macro in one of two ways:

*   Use the macro recorder to record keystrokes and mouse actions as you perform them. The macro recorder can record only those actions you perform with the keyboard or mouse. The macro recorder is a good choice for creating simple macros. Whenever possible I use a Macro recorder.
*   Enter a series of commands in the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language.

After you record a macro, you should run it to test whether it works as intended. Running a macro means Excel performs each of the steps in the same order as when it was recorded. To run the macro you created, you can either use the shortcut key you specified or select the macro in the Macro dialog box.

##### Saving and Opening a Macro-Enabled Workbook

Workbooks that contain macros pose a security risk for Excel because macros could contain viruses or malicious software. The default Excel file format does not support macros. If you want to save a workbook containing macros, you must save it in the macro-enabled workbook format, preserving both your data and the macro code attached to the workbook. A macro-enabled workbook has the .xlsm file extension. When you open a file with macros, Excel checks the opening workbook to see if it contains any macros. When the workbook opens the first time, a SECURITY WARNING appears in the Message Bar with an option to enable or disable macros

###### Security Warning for a macro-enabled workbook
![Figure 12-25 Security Warning for a macro-enabled workbook](../images/modules/M12/Figure%2012-25.png)

> Tip: When Excel opens a file with macros, it checks to see if it contains a macro. The response you see is based on the security level set on the computer. If you know a workbook contains macros that you or a coworker created, you can enable them. If you do not know the source, do not enable the macro!
> 
> Tip: The default Excel workbook (.xlsx file extension) does not allow macros to be stored as part of the file. If you click the Yes button in the Save dialog box, this workbook will be saved as a macro-free workbook, which means the macros you created will be lost.

## [](#assigning-macros-to-shapes-and-buttons)Assigning Macros to Shapes and Buttons

Another way to run a macro is to assign it to a button placed directly in the worksheet. Macro buttons are often a better way to run macros than shortcut keys.

##### Assigning a Macro to a Shape

Any object within a workbook that can be clicked can be turned into an object that runs a macro. Assigning a macro to a graphic object simplifies an application for users because they only have to click objects within the workbook, not interact with the Excel ribbon or buttons.

The Developer tab includes options for creating form controls , which are form elements used for entering data and running commands. You can create form controls for input boxes, check boxes, spinners, and list boxes among other choices. The controls can also be linked to worksheet cells so that a user can set or change a cell value by clicking a form control.

##### Data Entry with a Data Form

Another way of automating the data entry process is with an Excel data form, which is a dialog box containing the field names from the table or data range along with input boxes for entering new data. Data forms can be helpful when people who are unfamiliar with Excel need to enter data. They can also be useful when a worksheet is very wide and requires repeated horizontal scrolling.

## [](#working-with-the-vba-editor)Working with the VBA Editor

To view the code of a macro, open the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Editor—it allows you to view, debug, edit, and manage VBA code. The editor is a separate application that works with Excel and other Office programs to fix, edit, and manage VBA code

You can access the VBA Editor through the Macro dialog box or the Visual Basic button in the Code group on the Developer tab.

###### VBA Editor window
![Figure 12-33 VBA Editor window](../images/modules/M12/Figure%2012-33.png)

All macros are actually small programs written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). You can create a new macro or edit an existing macro in the Visual Basic Editor. In the editor, you will see the actual VBA statements that make the macro work and can view and edit the commands.

> Tip: I normally use the macro recorder to record the macro initially, and then I use the VBA editor to modify it.

##### Understanding Sub Procedures

In VBA, macros are stored in blocks of code called sub procedures, which have the general syntax

*   Sub procedure(arguments)
*   ‘comments
*   commands

##### Editing a Macro with the VBA Editor

To enter a VBA command, you write the text of the command in the Code window. As you type a command, the editor will provide pop-up windows to assist you in writing error-free code.

If you decide you don’t want a tab displayed on the ribbon, you can remove it  
To remove the Developer tab from the ribbon:

*   Right-click any tab on the ribbon, and then click Customize the Ribbon
*   In the Main Tabs box, click the Developer check box to remove the checkmark
*   Click the OK button

##### Proskills Decision Making: _Planning and Recording a Macro_

><hr>Planning and practice help to ensure you create an error-free macro. First, decide what you want to accomplish. Then, consider the best way to achieve those results. Next, practice the keystrokes and mouse actions before you begin recording. This may seem like extra work, but it reduces the chance of error when you actually record the macro. As you set up a macro, consider the following:>

>Choose a descriptive name that helps you recognize the macro’s purpose.
>
>Weigh the benefits of selecting a shortcut key against its drawbacks. Although a shortcut key is an easy way to run a macro, you are limited to one-letter shortcuts, which can make it difficult to remember the purpose of each shortcut key. In addition, the macro shortcut keys will override the standard Office shortcuts for that workbook.
>
>Store the macro with the current workbook unless the macro can be used with other workbooks.
>
>Include a description that provides an overview of the macro and perhaps your name and contact information.
>
>Good decision making includes thinking about what to do and what not to do as you progress to your goals. This is true when developing a macro as well.

## [](#protecting-against-macro-viruses)Protecting Against Macro Viruses

A virus is a computer program designed to copy itself into other programs with the intention of causing mischief or harm. Macro viruses use a program’s own macro programming language to distribute the virus. It can be destructive, or it can modify or delete files that may not be recoverable.

Because a macro is actually a program, a virus can be attached to the macro. A macro is attached to a workbook and just opening the workbook can cause the macro to be run. If a macro has an attached virus, running the macro could infect the computer being used to view the workbook. The first line of defense is to be sure you know where the workbook came from and whether the source is trustworthy. Excel allows us to specify security for any workbook opened within Excel. There are four levels of security: very high, high, medium, and low.

##### Macro Security Settings

The macro security settings control how Excel manages a macro-enabled workbook. They are set in the Trust Center, which is a central location for all of the security settings in Office.

##### To access the Trust Center:

1.  On the ribbon, click the File tab, and then in the navigation bar, click Options to open the Excel Options dialog box.  
    2.Click Trust Center in the list of option categories.
2.  Click the Trust Center Settings button to view or change specific security settings

Another way to mark a trusted workbook is to assign it a digital signature, which marks the workbook as coming from a trusted author. Digital signatures are added as the last step before distributing a workbook to a wide audience of users.
